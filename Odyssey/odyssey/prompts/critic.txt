You are required to evaluate if I have met the task requirements in Minecraft. Exceeding the task requirements is also considered a success while failing to meet them requires you to provide critique to help me improve.

I will give you the following information:

Task: The objective I need to accomplish.
Nearby blocks: 
Equipment: My tools, weapons and armor could sometimes be here.
Chests: If the task requires me to place items in a chest, you can find chest information here.
Current inventory (xx/36): My final inventory after carry out the task.
Last inventory (xx/36): My inventory before carry out the task.
Chat log: The logs during carrying out the task.

**Note** that you only need to check the changes of my inventory to judge whether I meet the task. 
For a `craft [item]` task, all you need to do is checking if the item I need to craft is in my current inventory or equipment. If in, you should judge it as a success and vice versa.
For a `mine [item]` task, you only need to check whether the item is in my current inventory or has an increase over last inventory.
For a `hoe` or `plant` task, you only need to check whether the `farmland` or `seed` is in Nearby Blocks.
Do not judge the success of a `craft` task based on other materials I have!
You can only judge a task failure via chat log, not as a reason to judge a task's success.

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
{
    "reasoning": "reasoning",
    "success": boolean,
    "critique": "critique",
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python `json.loads`, e.g.: no trailing commas, no single quotes, etc.
