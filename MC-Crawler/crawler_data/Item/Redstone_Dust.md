# Redstone Dust
Redstone dust is a mineral that can transmit redstone power as a wire when placed as a block. It is also used in crafting and brewing.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
Redstone dust can be broken instantly using any tool, or without a tool, and drops itself as an item.

Redstone dust is removed and drops as an item if:

- its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed
- waterorlavaflows into its space
- apistontries to push it or moves a block into its space

| Block    | Redstone Dust       |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.05                |

### Mining
See also: Redstone Ore § Natural generation

Redstone ore mined using an iron pickaxe or higher drops 4 or 5 redstone dust (or more with Fortune, averaging at 6 redstone dust with Fortune III). If mined with Silk Touch, the block drops itself instead of redstone dust. When the ore itself is clicked on/touched, it emits a light level of 9 and glows.

### Natural generation
15 lengths of redstone dust are naturally generated as part of the trap in each jungle pyramid. 5 lengths of redstone dust can be found in one type of a jail cell room in a woodland mansion. In ancient cities, multiple pieces of redstone dust can be found integrated into circuitry.

### Mob loot
Witches have a chance of dropping 0–2 redstone dust upon death. This is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0–5 redstone dust.

### Trading
Novice-level cleric villagers sell two redstone dust for one emerald.

### Villager gifts
See also: Tutorials/Raid farming

In Java Edition, when the player has the Hero of the Village status effect, clerics might throw that player a redstone dust as a gift.

## Usage
Redstone dust is used for brewing, crafting, and in redstone circuits by placing it on the ground to create redstone wire. It can also be used to power redstone components.

###  Redstone component
When placed in the world, redstone dust becomes a block of redstone wire, which can transmit redstone power.

#### Placement
Examples of redstone wire configuration. Top Left: Redstone wire connects diagonally vertically through non-opaque blocks. Top Right: Redstone wire does not connect diagonally vertically through opaque blocks. Center: Redstone wire gets darker as its power level drops, to a maximum of 15 blocks from a power source.
Examples of redstone wire placements.
Redstone dust can be placed on opaque blocks as well as glowstone, upside-down slabs, glass, upside-down stairs, and hoppers. It can also be placed on some transparent blocks; see Opacity/Placement for more information. It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.[1]

Redstone wire configures itself to point toward adjacent redstone power components and transmission component connection points. Redstone wire also configures itself to point toward adjacent redstone wire one block higher or lower – unless there is a solid opaque block above the lower redstone wire.

If there is only one such adjacent redstone component, redstone wire configures itself into a  line pointing both at the neighbor and away from it. If there are two or more such adjacent components, redstone wire connects them in the form of , , , or  as needed.

When there are no adjacent components, a single redstone wire configures itself into a  plus sign, which can provide power in all four directions. By right-clicking, it can be changed into a  dot, which does not provide power to any of the four directions.

Redstone wire does not automatically configures itself to point toward mechanism components; the only exception are the back and side faces of pistons and sticky pistons in Bedrock Edition. If such a configuration is desired, the other neighbors of the redstone wire must be arranged to create it, i.e the redstone dust must be placed in a way that it would be pointed at the block’s location even if it were not there.

When redstone wire is reconfigured after placement, it does not update other redstone components around it of the change unless that reconfiguration also includes a change in power level or another component provides an update. This can create situations where a mechanism component remains activated when it shouldn't, or vice versa, until it receives an update from something else – a "feature" of redstone wire that can be used to make a block update detector.


#### Behavior




























































In Bedrock Edition, the signal can go down from glass blocks.




























































However, the signal can never go down from slabs.
Redstone wire can transmit power, which can be used to operate mechanism components (doors, pistons, redstone lamps, etc.).
Redstone wire can be "powered" by a number of methods:

- from an adjacentpower componentor a strongly-powered block
- from the output of a redstone repeater or redstone comparator
- from adjacent redstone wire. The powering dust can be a level higher or lower, but with restrictions:
	- Redstone dust can be powered by redstone dust that is one level lower, or on anopaqueblock one level higher. A transparent block cannot‌[Java Edition  only]pass power downward.
	- The block "between" the two dust blocks must be air or transparent. A solid block there "cuts" the connection between the higher and lower dust.

The "power level" of redstone dust can vary from 0 to 15. Most power components power-up adjacent redstone dust to power level 15, but a few (daylight sensors, trapped chests, and weighted pressure plates) may create a lower power level. Redstone repeaters output power level 15 (when turned on), but redstone comparators may output a lower power level.

Redstone wire can transmit power up to 15 blocks.
Power level drops by 1 for every block of redstone wire it crosses. Thus, redstone wire can transmit power for no more than 15 blocks. To go further, the power level must be re-strengthened – typically with a redstone repeater.

Powered redstone wire on top of, or pointing at, an opaque block provides weak power to the block. A weakly-powered block cannot power other adjacent redstone wire, but can still power redstone repeaters and comparators, and activate adjacent mechanism components. Transparent blocks cannot be powered.

When redstone wire is unpowered, it appears dark red. When powered, it becomes bright red at power level 15, fading to darker shades with decreasing power. Powered redstone wire also produces "dust" particles of the same color.

While redstone wire always provides power to the directions it points into, it can still point into directions in which it cannot give power. If redstone wire comes in the form of a cross, the player can right-click to toggle it between a cross and dot. A redstone dot does not power anything adjacent to it, but powers the block under it.
