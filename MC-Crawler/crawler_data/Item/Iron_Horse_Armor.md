### Crafting
| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Leather     |                 |

Only leather horse armor can be crafted; other horse armor can be obtained only from chest loot from structures listed above.

### Trading
Expert-level leatherworker villagers sell leather horse armor for 6 emeralds as part of their trade.

## Usage
Only normal adult horses can wear armor; foals, donkeys, mules, and undead variants such as skeleton horses and zombie horses cannot be equipped with armor.

### Types
Horse armor has leather, iron, gold, and diamond variants. It does not have netherite or chainmail variants.

### Armor stands
Horse armor cannot be placed or displayed on armor stands as it would be on a horse.

### Protection
Horse armor can be equipped to horses either by manually placing it in its respective slot by pressing inventory while riding the horse (), or by using the horse with it.

There is a gradual increase in the defense given from a horse wearing the different types of armor. Note that golden horse armor provides more protection than iron horse armor, whereas the opposite is true for player armor. Diamond horse armor is the only horse armor type to provide any armor toughness.

| Material | Armor      | Armor Toughness |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Leather  | 3 ()       | 0               |
| Iron     | 5 ()       | 0               |
| Gold     | 7 ()       | 0               |
| Diamond  | 11 (× 5.5) | 2               |

If a horse dies while equipped with any horse armor, it drops its normal loot, a saddle (if it had one), and the horse armor.

Leather horse armor protects horses from freezing in powder snow, but it does not negate other powder snow effects (e.g., falling through, inability to jump).

### Durability
Unlike player armor, horse armor does not have durability. This means a single horse armor can be used infinitely unless destroyed.

### Enchanting
Unlike player armor, horse armor cannot be enchanted in survival mode. However, in Java Edition Creative mode, horse armor can be used with an anvil to enchant with Depth Strider, Thorns, Respiration, Feather Falling, and Curse of vanishing. Other enchantments can be applied, but they have no effect.

### Dyeing
Main article: Dyeing § Dyeing armor
Leather horse armor can be dyed by combining it with dye(s) through crafting‌[JE  only] or by using it on a cauldron containing dyed water.‌[BE  only] Using leather horse armor on a cauldron containing ordinary water removes any dye from it.
