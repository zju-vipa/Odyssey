#### Unit repair

A diamond helmet can be repaired in an anvil by adding diamonds, with each diamond restoring 25% the helmet's maximum durability, rounded down. Two diamond helmets can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the helmet's enchantments.

↑ a b Enchantment probabilities are the same as a level-20 to level-39 enchantment would be on an enchantment table that had no cap at level 30, and that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.

↑ a b All enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.

↑ a b The item has between 80% and 100% of its total durability.


### Mob loot
If a zombie, husk, stray or skeleton is wearing armor, there is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop a helmet upon death. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.

### Trading
In Java Edition, master-level armorer villagers always sell an enchanted diamond helmet for 11-27 emeralds.

In Bedrock Edition, master-level armorer villagers have a 50% chance to sell enchanted diamond helmet for 8 emeralds.

## Usage
Helmets can be placed in the top armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.

### Defense points
Defense points are each signified by half of a shirt of mail in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

Diamond helmet adds 3 () defense points.

### Durability
Diamond helmet can absorb 363 damage before being destroyed.

Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits helmets can endure.

#### Repair
Diamond helmets may be repaired by using them along with some diamonds in an anvil. They may also be repaired by crafting them together with another diamond helmet.

### Enchantments
A helmet can receive the following enchantments.

### Armor trimming
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a diamond helmet, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, or diamond).


These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
