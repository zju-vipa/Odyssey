### Garbage
Garbage is considered a "compound", but the only way to produce it is to activate the lab table when its inputs are an invalid recipe. It has no uses.

## Usage
Certain compounds are used as ingredients in crafting or lab table experiments. Natural compounds have uses outside of chemistry, detailed in their respective articles.
