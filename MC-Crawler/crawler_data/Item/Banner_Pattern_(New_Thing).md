The percentage shown in the proposal is this value multiplied by 100 and rounded. For example, if the value is 1.28, knockback is multiplied by 128%. The visible percentage will always be an integer from -2147483648 to 2147483647, even if this value is outside these bounds. When using/vote, setting the value to 1 repeals this rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

When using/vote, setting the value to 1 repeals this rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Only value 0 ("Super 1000") can be approved by normal votes, but since setting the value to 0 repeals this rule, normal votes cannot actually add this rule to the approved rules list. When using /vote, the value can be set to any integer from -2147483648 to 2147483647. Non-positive values have no effect on the debug screen. Negative values set the level to "Abysmal", and setting the value to 2147483647 changes it to "L0L N00B". All values in between set the level to a procedurally generated string of text, followed by the value plus 1 and then "000" appended at the end. The starting text picks a few random words out of "Super", "Hyper", "Opti", "Extra", "Extreme", "Incredible", "Beyond", "Ultra", "Atomic", "Warp", "Performance", "Realistic", "Future", "Quantum" and "Quad", and combines them together in a random order.                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

If this value is set, the proposal text is "Villagers accept randomly assigned item instead of gems (reshuffle)", and is shown as "Villagers accept randomly assigned item instead of gems" in the approved rules screen.  value: The resource location of the item villagers now use as currency. This value takes priority over  seed, and is used even if both are set. When using /vote, setting this value to minecraft:emerald repeals this rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Toasts
- Added a new toast notification that appears every few seconds when the player has not yet opened their voting screen, and a vote proposal has started. The notification title is "New proposal received!" in purple text, while the main message differs depending on how long has passed since the first notification appeared.
	- Opening the voting screen once prevents these toasts from ever appearing in the future, unlessoptions.txtis edited externally.
	- These toasts use a value called "urgency" which has four values:LOW,MEDIUM,CONCERNING,WHY_ARE_YOU_NOT_DOING_IT.
	- They start atLOWurgency, which lasts 2 minutes, change toMEDIUMfor 2 minutes, then toCONCERNINGfor 1 minute and finally toWHY_ARE_YOU_NOT_DOING_ITuntil the world is closed or the voting screen is opened.
	- The notification's main message changes depending on the level of urgency.
		- AtLOWurgency, toasts appear every 15 seconds, last 5 seconds each and can have the following messages:
			- Pressvto open voting screen
			- To open voting screen, pressv
			- New vote started, pressvto cast your vote
		- AtMEDIUMurgency, toasts appear every 10 seconds, last 3 seconds each and can have the following messages:

			- You have new vote proposals to review, pressvto access!
		- AtCONCERNINGurgency, toasts appear every 5 seconds, last 2 seconds each and can have the following messages:

			- Not pressingvhas been proven less fun that pressingv
			- Do you want more phantoms? That's how you get more phantoms! Pressv
