## Obtaining
### Mob loot
In Java Edition, the drowned mob has a 3.75% chance of spawning with a fishing rod equipped.
In Bedrock Edition, naturally-spawned drowned has 0.85% chance to spawn with fishing rod, while converted drowned has 1% chance to spawn with it.
If killed, they have an 8.5% chance of dropping this fishing rod. That chance increases by 1% for each level of Looting applied to a weapon (up to 11.5% chance). The dropped item is damaged and never enchanted.

#### Unit repair
Main article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair
Repair & NameDamaged Fishing Rod
A fishing rod can be combined with another fishing rod in an anvil, preserving the enchantments of both.

### Fishing
Enchanted fishing rods can be obtained as "treasure" items from fishing, and unenchanted ones as "junk" items.

### Trading
Journeyman-level fisherman villagers sell enchanted fishing rods for 6 emeralds.
The enchantments are the same as the ones obtained from an enchantment table at levels 5–19.

### 
If a carrot on a stick or a warped fungus on a stick is used to the point of zero durability, it becomes a fishing rod again.

## Usage
### Fishing
Main article: Fishing
Fishing rods can be cast into water. After a short period of time, a stream of bubble particles approaches the fishing rod. If the rod is reeled in once the particles "bite" the bobber, the player obtains a fish, junk, or possibly a treasure item. If the fishing rod was in the player's hand and is no longer, the fishing bobber entity despawns, unless the fishing rod to the off-hand or it has been swapped with another fishing rod.[citation needed]

### Hooking mobs and other entities
See also: Fishing § Fishing rod durability

The fishing rod can be used to hook mobs, items‌[Java Edition  only] and some entities, including players. The fishing rod can then be reeled in, dragging the hooked object toward the player without dealing damage. Reeling in a mob or entity costs 5 points of durability, and reeling in an item costs 3 points. Reeling a mob pulls it toward the player with a speed of 1⁄10 the distance between mob and player.

Besides mobs and items, entities that can be reeled in include: 

- Boats
- Boat with Chests
- Minecartsof any type
- Armor Stands
- Shulker Bullets
- Fireballs
- PrimedTNT
- Anyfalling blocksuch as:
	- Sand
	- Gravel
	- Dragon Eggs
	- Concrete Powder
	- Scaffolding
	- Snow‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
	- Anvils

Some entities can be hooked, but cannot be reeled in: 

- Mobs riding/being ridden by other mobs (inBedrock Edition, the hooked mob dismounts)
- Paintings
- Item Frames
- Lead knots
- End Crystals
- Shulkers

Attempting to reel in said entities still costs durability to the rod.

The rest of the entities cannot be hooked at all: 

- Throwneggs
- Thrownsnowballs
- Thrownender pearls
- Throwneyes of ender
- Thrownpotions
- Thrownbottles o' enchanting
- Small fireballs
- Dragon fireballs
- Wither skulls
- Firework rocketsin flight
- Arrowsin flight
- Area effect cloud
- XP orbs

The hook can also be used to activate wooden pressure plates or weighted pressure plates.

### Enchantments
A fishing rod can receive the following enchantments:
