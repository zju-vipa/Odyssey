### Fishing
Bones can also be obtained by fishing as part of the junk category. The best chance of catching a bone is achieved without the Luck of the Sea enchantment, yielding a 1.1% chance.

## Usage
### Helmet


While a bone cannot be equipped in the head slot in Survival mode, equipping it using commands causes it to appear in the player's mouth.

### Taming
Using a bone on a wild wolf has a 1⁄3 chance of taming it. Bones cannot tame a hostile wolf or a wolf that has already been tamed. However, bones can be used to attract the attention of the tamed ones.

### Crafting ingredient
A bone can be crafted into 3 bone meal.
