### Mob loot
#### Pillagers
When killed, a pillager has a small chance (8.5%) of dropping a loaded or unloaded crossbow with random durability; the drop rate increases by 1% per level of Looting: 9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III. The dropped crossbow can rarely (10% chance) be enchanted at level 5–19 regardless of being enchanted when it spawned.

Crossbows dropped by pillagers may have multiple enchantments, including duplicate enchantments on the same weapon.

#### Piglins
Piglins have a chance of wielding a crossbow upon spawning, and they also have a small chance (8.5%) of dropping a loaded or unloaded crossbow of random durability when killed; this rate increases by 1% per level of Looting: 9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III. It can rarely (10% chance) be enchanted at level 5–19 regardless of being enchanted when spawned.

### Trading
Journeyman-level fletcher villagers offer to sell an unenchanted crossbow for 3 emeralds.

Master-level fletcher villagers have a 1⁄16 (6.25%) chance of selling an enchanted crossbow for 8 emeralds.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

Master-level fletcher villagers have 2⁄3 chance of selling an enchanted crossbow for 7-22 emeralds.‌[Java Edition  only]

Despite using iron ingots in their crafting recipe, crossbows cannot be smelted into iron nuggets.[1]

### Weapon
Charging and shooting the crossbow in Bedrock Edition.
Crossbows are similar to bows, but take longer to load and are slightly more powerful, shooting farther with slightly higher accuracy. Alternatively, they can be loaded with a firework rocket, which flies in a straight line.

Load them by using them, which makes the player move at sneak speed. Unlike bows, the arrow or firework rocket can be fired only if the player releases the use button after the crossbow is loaded‌[Java Edition  only]  or if the crossbow finishes its loading animation ‌[Bedrock Edition  only]. At this point, it must be used a second time to fire its bolt.

Once it has reached full charge, the player's speed returns to normal. After that, shooting a charged crossbow does not delay any of the player's current action like sprinting or swimming.

The crossbow can even be placed in another inventory slot or into an item frame without the arrow or firework rocket being unloaded or fired. A charged crossbow also remains charged after enchanting it with an enchantment table or with an anvil.

In order to use the crossbow, at least one arrow or firework rocket must be present in the inventory. The player can choose the type of arrow to fire based on its location in their inventory:

- Arrows in the off-hand, or the selectedhotbarslot if the crossbow is in the off-hand, are prioritized first.
- If there are no arrows in the off-hand or selected hotbar slot, the arrow closest to slot 0 is selected.

Crossbows take 1.25 seconds (25 ticks) to load. 

The player can load either an arrow, spectral arrow, tipped arrow (of any effect) or a firework (of any color/type).

Endermen teleport away from projectile paths, so they cannot be hit with crossbow arrows. However, they can still get harmed by firework rocket explosions, if they can't detect the firework rocket.

Attack strength
Java Edition:

| Damage  | Arrow   | Max firework |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Minimum | 7       | 11× 5.5      |
| Average | 9       | 14.5× 7.25   |
| Maximum | 11× 5.5 | 18× 9        |

Bedrock Edition

- Always 9

### Fireworks
Firework rockets can be fired by loading the crossbow only while holding the rockets in the off-hand. They fly at 32 m/s. Firework rockets with higher flight duration have a longer time before they explode and therefore travel farther. Firing a firework rocket uses 3 durability points per shot.

| Firework rocket range |                    |                  |           |
|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Minimum               | Average            | Maximum          | Gunpowder |
| 32m (20 ticks)        | 40.8m (25.5 ticks) | 49.6m (31 ticks) | 1 ()      |
| 48m (30 ticks)        | 56.8m (35.5 ticks) | 65.6m (41 ticks) | 2 ()      |
| 64m (40 ticks)        | 72.8m (45.5 ticks) | 81.6m (51 ticks) | 3 ()      |

Firework rockets also work with the Multishot enchantment, enabling the player to shoot 3 firework rockets at a time. The increased durability usage stacks, resulting in 9 durability being consumed with each shot.

A shot firework rocket explodes instantly when it hits a mob or block.‌[Java Edition  only] If the firework rocket has no explosion effect, it deals no damage. The explosion of a firework rocket deals 5 to 6 points of damage, with one firework star. The explosion has a radius of roughly 4 blocks, which is unaffected by the firework star's effect. Each additional firework star on the rocket deals an additional 1 to 2 points of damage, for a maximum of 11 × 5.5 to 18 × 9 with 7 firework stars. The flight duration of the firework increases the maximum range the firework can travel before exploding, but does not affect the damage output. Likewise, the damage remains the same regardless of any dyes used. The Piercing enchantment does not affect firework rockets shot from crossbows. Unlike an arrow shot from a bow, the firework does not slow down under water.
