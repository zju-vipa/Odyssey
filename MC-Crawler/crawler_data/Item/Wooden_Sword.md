#### Unit repair

A wooden sword can be repaired in an anvil by adding wood planks of any kind, with each repair material restoring 25% the sword's maximum durability, rounded down. Two wooden swords can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the sword's enchantments.

## Usage
### Attacking
Pressing attack while holding a wooden sword inflicts damage on both mobs and other players. Upon damaging a mob or player, the sword's durability decreases by 1. In Java Edition, wooden swords can perform a sweep attack.

In Java Edition, it takes two hits to break a minecart or boat with a wooden sword, with neither hit taking any durability. In Bedrock Edition, it takes one hit to break a minecart and eight hits to break a boat with a wooden sword, with each hit decreasing the sword's durability by 1. 

### Damage
Main article: Damage
#### Java Edition
Wooden swords have an attack speed of 1.6 and take 0.625 seconds to recover. 

| Attack damage | Attack speed | Recovery time                  | DPS | Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------------------|-----|-----------------------------------|
| 4             | 1.6          | 0.625 seconds (12.5game ticks) | 6.4 | 236× 118                          |


↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is Lifetime damage minimum = Durability × Damage per hit. It ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes the sword is at maximum charge. 


#### Bedrock Edition
In Bedrock Edition, wooden swords have no attack cooldown or sweep attack, and deal the following damage:

| Attack damage | Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| 5             | 300× 150                          |


↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is Lifetime damage minimum = Durability × Damage per hit. It ignores enchantments and critical hits


### Sword breaking times
Main article: Sword § Breaking
A wooden sword can also be used to destroy some blocks quicker than with fists. All swords have the same mining speed, so the wooden sword is just as useful for breaking blocks as any other sword.

If an wooden sword is enchanted with Silk Touch, either using Creative or commands, it can be used to obtain a cobweb as an item by breaking it.

### Enchantments
Main article: Sword § Enchantments
The wooden sword can receive all the same enchantments as any other sword.

### Fuel
Wooden swords can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1 item per sword.
