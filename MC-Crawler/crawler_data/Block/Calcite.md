### Natural generation
Calcite generates naturally as part of the structure of amethyst geodes, between the smooth basalt and block of amethyst layers. It also generates in the stony peaks in strips.


## Usage
Calcite is currently used only for decoration. It has lower blast resistance and hardness than stone-related blocks.
