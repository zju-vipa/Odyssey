## Usage
The light from a glowstone block is completely blocked by tinted glass.
Tinted glass behaves like an opaque block, blocking light completely, despite being visually transparent. However, it isn't a solid block, and as with regular glass, mobs do not suffocate inside it. Unlike other types of glass, it cannot be turned into glass panes. Mobs do not spawn on top, similar to regular glass.
