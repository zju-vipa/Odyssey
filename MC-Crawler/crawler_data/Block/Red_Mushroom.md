## Obtaining
### Breaking
Mushrooms can be instantly mined with any tool, including punching it. Mining a huge mushroom block drops up to 2 mushrooms of the same color. Fortune does not affect the drop rate of mushrooms in any form.[1]

A mushroom also breaks instantly and drops as an item if:

- the block below it is moved or destroyed
- afluidflows over it
- a block next to it changes state, but only when it isnotonpodzol,mycelium, ornyliumand light level is 13 or higher

| Block    | Mushrooms           |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.05                |

### Natural generation
Mushrooms naturally generate in poorly lit areas (light level of 12 or less). If this condition is met, each chunk has 1⁄8 (12.5%) chance to generate red mushroom and 1⁄4 (25.0%) chance to generate brown mushroom, in the form of random patches.[2]

Mushrooms also generate on the surface of a swamp, old growth taiga or mushroom fields biome, along with anywhere in the Nether. Unlike plants, they are able to generate on top of nearly any block type.

In Java Edition, they are commonly found in patches on the bedrock ceiling of the Nether, and are the only blocks that can generate there. 

Witch huts have a flower pot with a red mushroom inside. Mushrooms also generate inside "mushroom farm" rooms in woodland mansions.

#### Fallen trees
In Bedrock Edition, fallen oak, birch, spruce, and jungle trees can have up to 2 mushrooms generated on them.

### Huge mushrooms
Mining a huge mushroom of either color has a chance of dropping a mushroom of the same color, for each block mined.


### Mob loot
Shearing a red or brown mooshroom drops 5 mushrooms of the corresponding color and turns it into a normal cow.

‌In Java Edition 1.21‌[upcoming], shearing a bogged drops 2 mushrooms, which could be 2 brown mushrooms, 2 red mushrooms or one of each.

### Chest loot
| Item           | Structure   | Container | Quantity | Chance          |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
|                |             |           |          | Bedrock Edition |
| Brown Mushroom | Bonus Chest | Chest     | 1–2      | 100%            |

### Trading
Mushrooms can be bought from a wandering trader for an emerald.

## Usage
Mushrooms can be planted and grown on blocks that have a full top surface in light levels below 13 and not directly underneath the sky. They cannot be planted on the top surfaces of slabs or stairs.[3] For more information, see Opacity/Placement. If planted on mycelium, podzol or nylium, they can stay planted in any light level, including be planted and remain under light from sky above. Both brown and red mushrooms grow at the same rate regardless of the light level.[4][5]

### Huge mushrooms
When bone meal is applied to a mushroom, the mushroom has a chance to grow into a huge mushroom of the same color, provided that it is on a proper block (grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt or moss block at a light level of 12 or below; on podzol, mycelium or nylium at any light level) and has enough space (7×7×8).

### Spread
See also: Tutorials/Mushroom farming

When receiving a random tick, a mushroom has a chance of spreading to a nearby block (including even above and below diagonally) if there are fewer than five mushrooms of the same type in a 9×9×3 volume around the original mushroom.

### Light source
Brown mushrooms emit a barely visible light level of 1.[6] However, they do not emit light in flower pots.[7]

### Decoration
Either type of mushroom can be planted in a flower pot.
