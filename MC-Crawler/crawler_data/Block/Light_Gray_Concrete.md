## Obtaining
### Breaking
Concrete requires a pickaxe to be mined. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

### Natural generation
Red and cyan concrete can be found in trail ruins.

### Post-generation
Concrete powder becoming solid concrete on contact with water. Notice the sand block falls through the water, while the concrete powder instantly solidifies on contact with water. (Click for bigger image)
Concrete is formed when concrete powder comes into contact with a block of water (source block, flowing or waterlogged). If next to a waterlogged block, it must be adjacent to the sides where water can flow out from, such as the open sides of stairs, but not the back side of stairs or any sides of waterlogged leaves.

### Renewability
Concrete is renewable as all of the crafting ingredients of concrete powder are renewable. However, without glitches, sand is only renewably obtained through the wandering trader, which spawns infrequently and only allows a limited number of trades per spawn, making it impractical to obtain it (and by extension, concrete) through only renewable means.

## Usage
The bright and solid colors of concrete make it useful for decoration. It has more pronounced colors than terracotta, and unlike wool, is not flammable.

As a building material, its hardness is slightly higher than stone, but its blast resistance is significantly lower.[1]

### Note blocks
Concrete can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass drum" sound.
