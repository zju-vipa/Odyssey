## Spawning
Poisonous potato zombies spawn in light level 0, rarely in the Overworld and much more commonly in the Potato dimension. Just like with regular zombies, 5% of poisonous potato zombies spawn as babies, and those have a chance to spawn as chicken jockeys.

Three poisonous potato zombies spawn during the mega spud's 3rd phase.

↑ Dropped only when kill credit is given to the player


Poisonout potato headpiece does not drop when a poisonous potato zombie is killed by a charged creeper's explosion; instead, a normal zombie head is dropped.

## Behavior
Poisonous potato zombies are hostile not only toward players, but also any other zombie-type mob, including normal zombies, zombie villagers, husks, drowned, and zombified piglins. Any zombie-type mob killed by poisonous potato zombie becomes another poisonous potato zombie. Unlike normal zombies, they don't attack villagers, and villagers don't run away from them.
