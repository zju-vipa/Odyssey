An ice chunk is a non-attackable entity that can be summoned by icelogers within the creeping winter DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.

### Appearance
Ice chunks appear as three ice blocks covered in snow, with horizontal and vertical slabs of ice attached to a center ice block. The center block itself is slightly taller and narrower than a regular block.

### Behavior
Ice chunks stay directly above the target until they drop, stunning heroes and allies. Ice chunks function similarly to geomancer walls, geomancer bombs, and abomination vines in that each of them are non-attackable entities that are summoned by a hostile mob to harm a target. If an ice chunk hits a tall structure, it will break. Ice chunks do not break on mission borders or on other ice chunks. An ice chunk can harm another mob on which it lands.
