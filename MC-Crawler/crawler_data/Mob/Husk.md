# Husk
A husk is a variant of a zombie that spawns in deserts. They function similar to zombies, except they do not burn in sunlight and inflict Hunger with their unarmed attacks.

## Spawning
Husks spawn at a light level of 0 in the desert, mostly replacing zombies in these biomes.

In Java Edition, husks spawn directly under the sky in groups of 4 in place of 80% of all zombies spawned in desert biomes variants.

In Bedrock Edition, husks spawn on the surface in groups of 2-4 in place of 70% of all zombies spawned in desert biomes.

### Trial spawners
‌In Java Edition 1.21 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.0‌[upcoming], husks have a chance to be selected as the "melee" mob for trial spawners in trial chambers.

## Variants
### Baby husks and chicken jockeys
Three adult husks and one baby husk.
All mobs that can be ridden by baby husks in Bedrock Edition.
In Java Edition, there is a 5% chance for husks to spawn as babies, and baby husks have a chance to spawn as a chicken jockey.

In Bedrock Edition, 15% of naturally spawned baby husks can start riding a mob and become a jockey when it tries attacking a villager, player, or golem. They can ride:


 Adult chickens
 Untamed ocelots
 Untamed cats
 Untamed wolves
 Adult zombies
 Adult husks
 Adult zombified villagers
 Adult zombified piglins
Cows
 Adult unsaddled pigs
Sheep
 Adult untamed horses
 Adult untamed donkeys
 Adult untamed mules
 Adult skeleton horses
 Adult zombie horses
Mooshrooms
 Spiders that was not spawned as a jockey mount
 Cave spiders that was not spawned as a jockey mount
Pandas
Husks spawn with random values of knockback resistance between 0% and 5%.

## Behavior
A husk that drowns converts to a zombie (which can convert to a drowned).
Like zombies, husks are hostile toward the player, iron golems, villagers, baby turtles, and wandering traders and pursue those mobs on sight from 40 blocks away, as opposed to 16 blocks like most other hostile mobs. If any other mob attacks a husk on purpose, all other husks and zombie variants (except zombified piglins) within a 67×67×21 to 111×111×21 area become hostile toward the attacker. They attempt to avoid obstacles, including sheer cliffs, water, and lava, and try to find the shortest path to the player.

Husks apply Hunger to any player or mob they hit using a melee attack unless the husk is holding an item in its main hand or the player blocks the attack with a shield. This effect lasts for 7 × floor (regional difficulty) seconds.

Husks can break down doors successfully on Hard difficulty.

Husks seek out any nearby turtle eggs and trample them.

Husks can pick up items if the game rule mobGriefing is set to true, which prevents them from despawning.

A husk that is submerged in water for 30 seconds begins converting to a normal zombie, which takes an additional 15 seconds and cannot be stopped even if the husk leaves water. Once this process finishes, the zombie that it becomes has full health even if the husk has been damaged, and may further convert into a drowned if it remains submerged.

Being an undead mob, they are: 

- damaged by the status effectInstant Healthand healed by the status effectInstant Damage.
- unaffected by the status effectsRegenerationandPoison.
- ignored by thewither.
- affected by theSmiteenchantment.
- unable to swim inwater, but do not drown.
- a threat toarmadillos, causing them to hide in their shell.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]

### Taken equipment
Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up.

### Naturally-spawned equipment
Husk have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment (other than Halloween pumpkins), with random durability. Each level of Looting increases the chance 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III). These items include:

- Iron Shovel
- Iron Sword
- Random Armor(sometimesenchanted, made from leather, gold, chainmail, iron or diamond)

### Experience
Adult husks drop 5 and an additional 1–3 per naturally-spawned equipment. Baby husks drop 12.
