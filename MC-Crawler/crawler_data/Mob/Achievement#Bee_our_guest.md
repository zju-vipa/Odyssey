# Achievement
An achievement, known as a trophy on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, is a way to gradually guide new players into Minecraft and give them challenges to complete. In Java Edition, a system of advancements accomplishes this instead.

## Obtaining
The achievement UI as seen in Bedrock Edition.
There are 125 achievements in Bedrock Edition.

Every achievement is tracked per user account. They are not tracked separately per world; achievements earned in one world apply to all worlds using that edition and that user account. On most platforms that Bedrock Edition runs on, achievements are logged to a Microsoft account, and so players have to be logged in to their Microsoft account to earn them. On PlayStation 4, Bedrock achievements are logged as trophies to the player's console account, and if logged into a PlayStation Network account and online, they are synced with PlayStation Network but not the Xbox network (even if logged into a Microsoft account).

The "Locked" section when all achievements are completed.
They are independent of one another, allowing players to get them in any order. Once earned, they cannot be reset.

Every achievement is earned only in Survival mode. If the game is saved while in Creative mode, Flat or if cheats are turned on, the ability to earn achievements/trophies in that world is permanently disabled. Going back to Survival mode or turning off cheats does not re-enable it.

Except on PlayStation 4, a Microsoft account is used to track achievements. The game can be played without being logged in, but achievements cannot be earned when doing so. On PlayStation 4, trophies are logged when logged in to PlayStation Network. Otherwise they are stored locally and get synced once logged in.

Achievements grant the player gamerscore on all platforms except PlayStation 4, totaling 2,870. The achievements also show characters instead of blocks or items.

Some achievements also give rewards, which include emotes and character creator items. They can be unlocked only by completing their respective achievement. There are 83 achievements that offer rewards for their completion.
