# Crab
The crab was a proposed mob featured in the Mob Vote during Minecraft Live 2023, alongside the armadillo and penguin.[1] It would have spawned in mangrove swamps, and had a large arm that it could lose, dropping a crab claw. The crab claw could be used to place blocks from further away. Crabs could be bred with kelp. Crabs occasionally waved at players and other crabs.
