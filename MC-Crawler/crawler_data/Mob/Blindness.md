## Effect
See also: Fog § Blindness fog

The view from a player who is afflicted by blindness.
Blindness impairs a player's vision as if a thick black fog was surrounding them, with only the immediate area around them being visible. However, the sun and moon can be seen during clear weather.‌[Java Edition  only] Additionally, liquids do not fade into the fog perfectly. 

The effect also prevents the player from sprinting or inflicting critical hits, but does not stop an ongoing sprint.

The effect can be removed by drinking milk. In  Minecraft Education and Bedrock Edition when education options are enabled, drinking eye drops also removes blindness.

Blindness has no effect on mobs. This can be observed in Survival by having a fox eat suspicious stew made with an azure bluet.

Wardens are naturally blind and instead rely on detection via vibrations, smell and touch. This form of blindness is completely independent from the Blindness effect which, as with other mobs, has no effect on wardens.
