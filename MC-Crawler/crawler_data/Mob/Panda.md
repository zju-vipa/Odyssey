## Spawning
Pandas spawn rarely in groups of 1–2 in jungle biomes on grass blocks with at least a two-block space above them at a light level of 9 or more. They are slightly more common in bamboo jungles and have a 5% chance to spawn as cubs instead of adults. They do not spawn on podzol.[1]

Pandas spawn with a randomized personality, with the normal personality being the most common and the brown variant being the rarest.

## Drops
### Breeding
Upon successful breeding, 1–7 is dropped.

### On death
| Item |            | Roll Chance | Quantity (Roll Chance) |           |            |             |
|------|------------|-------------|------------------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
|      |            |             | Default                | Looting I | Looting II | Looting III |
|      | Bamboo(JE) | 100%        | 1                      | 1         | 1          | 1           |

- 1–3, if killed by a tamedwolfor theplayer.

Like other baby animals, killing a panda cub yields no items or experience.

### Sneezing
Baby pandas have 1⁄700 chance to drop 1 slimeball after they sneeze. This means that, on average, a weak baby panda produces a slimeball every 4 hours, 51 minutes, and 40 seconds, and any other baby panda produces 1 every 58 hours and 20 minutes.

## Behavior
Pandas act similarly to other neutral mobs; they attack when hurt but only once, similar to llamas and bees. Pandas do not attack on Peaceful difficulty. Pandas follow any player that is carrying bamboo and stop following if the player moves beyond approximately 16 blocks away. They also whimper if a thunderstorm is happening in the area. Adult pandas seek out bamboo and cake to eat.

Baby pandas have a 1⁄6000 chance (0.0167%) of sneezing every game tick. Weak baby pandas are more likely to sneeze with a 1⁄500 (0.2%) chance every tick. Sneezing makes all adult pandas within 10 blocks jump and rarely drops a slimeball. Baby pandas also occasionally roll over and jump around.

Pandas have one private inventory.

Pandas can be ridden by baby zombie variants.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

A lead cannot be used on a panda by normal means.[2] However, a panda can be leashed using a map editor or NBT editor.

If a panda is being attacked by a player near a villager, that villager displays angry particles.‌[Java Edition  only] However, it does not affect the popularity of the player.

Hostile pandas are far more vicious in Java Edition.

### Personalities
The different variations of pandas – from left to right: brown, lazy, worried, playful, weak, aggressive and normal.
Pandas have different personalities: normal, lazy, worried, playful, aggressive, weak, or brown.

- Normal pandas:
	- Identifiable by their frown.
	- Do not have unique personality actions.
- Lazy pandas:
	- Identifiable by their smile.
	- Lie on their backs.
	- Are slower than normal pandas, making them the slowest land mob in the game.
	- Do not follow a player who is holdingbamboowhile they're lying on their back.‌[JE  only]InBedrock Edition, if aplayeris holdingbamboo, a lazy panda stops lying on its back and starts following thatplayer.

A worried panda shaking and hiding its face during a thunderstorm.
- Worried pandas:
	- Identifiable by their worried expression.
	- Avoid the player and most hostile mobs, exceptslimes,magma cubes,ghasts,shulkers,phantomsand theender dragon.
	- Shake and hide their faces duringthunderstorms.
	- Do not eat bamboo orcakeitems on their own.‌[JE  only]

A Playful panda rolling.
- Playful pandas:
	- Identifiable by their tongues that stick out.
	- Roll over and jump around even as adults. The ability to roll may sometimes cause harm or kill the panda as it can accidentally roll off a cliff or into other environmental hazards.[3]
- Aggressive pandas:
	- Identifiable by their thick eyebrows and tight frown.
	- When hit, an aggressive panda attacks theplayerand other mobs continuously until the target dies or goes beyond detection range, instead of only once. It also doesn't panic when harmed.
	- When nearby pandas are attacked, unless killed in one hit,‌[JE  only]aggressive pandas becomes hostile toward the attacker.
	- Are slow, but havereachrivaling that of the player.
- Weak pandas:
	- Identifiable by their teary eyes and snotty noses.
	- Tend to sneeze more often as babies than regular baby pandas, and have half the health of other pandas.
- Brown pandas:
	- Identifiable by their brown color and frown.
	- Do not have unique personality actions, but are brown and white instead of the usual black and white.

### Breeding
The panda is the only animal to have extra breeding conditions. In Java Edition, pandas enter love mode when fed with bamboo, but breed only if there is at least one bamboo block (not including shoots) within a 7×7×3 area; otherwise the pandas briefly shake their heads and do not breed until that requirement is met. If only one panda is close to a bamboo block, the other panda shakes its head, but a baby is born.

In Bedrock Edition, there must be at least 8 bamboo blocks within a five-block radius of each panda in order for them to enter love mode. If a panda is fed without a sufficient amount of bamboo nearby, it sits and eats the bamboo instead of entering love mode.

Once pandas successfully breed, they produce a panda cub that remains neutral toward that player.

## Genetics
Each panda has two hidden values called "genes" or "alleles", as found in genetics. Pandas have a main gene and a hidden gene, each assigned to a particular trait. Normal, aggressive, lazy, worried, and playful personalities are dominant traits, while weak and brown personalities are recessive traits. If the main gene is a dominant gene, then it presents as the personality regardless of the hidden gene. If the main gene is recessive and the hidden gene is not the same trait, then a normal personality results. As recessive traits, weak and brown personalities occur if both the main and hidden genes of a panda are weak or brown, respectively. The hidden gene is relevant only for determining the panda's personality if the main gene is recessive.

When two pandas breed, each one passes one of their genes to their children, who then randomly mix both obtained genes as their respective main and hidden genes. There is also a 1⁄32 chance for each gene of the baby to mutate into another gene. Normal, weak, and brown traits more commonly result from mutations than other traits do. These probabilities also apply to naturally spawned pandas for their main and hidden genes.

| Mutated Gene | Probability |
|--------------|-------------|
| Normal       | 5⁄16        |
| Aggressive   | 1⁄16        |
| Lazy         | 1⁄16        |
| Worried      | 1⁄16        |
| Playful      | 1⁄16        |
| Weak         | 5⁄16        |
| Brown        | 1⁄8         |

The only way to directly observe the hidden gene of a panda (if they are not weak or brown, in which case the genes are certain) is to use the command : /data get entity @e[type=minecraft:panda,limit=1] HiddenGene‌[Java Edition  only] or using third-party NBT editors.
