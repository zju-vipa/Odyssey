#### Unit repair
Main article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair
Repair & NameDamaged Golden Axe
A golden axe can be repaired in an anvil by adding golden ingots, with each ingot restoring 25% of the axe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two golden axes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the axe's enchantments.

↑ a b All enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.


### Mob loot
#### Equipment
Main article: Drops § Equipped items
A piglin brute spawns with a golden axe and has an 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II, and 11.5% with Looting III) of dropping it upon death by the player. Also, in Java Edition, zombified piglins can drop their golden axe (with the same chance as piglin brute drop) if they have been zombified from a piglin brute.

### Villager gifts
Weaponsmith villagers occasionally throw golden axes at players with the Hero of the Village status effect.‌[Java Edition  only]

## Usage
### Breaking
Golden axes can break wood-related blocks faster than other tools. Breaking a block costs 1 durability.[note 1]


↑ Blocks that break instantly don't use up durability.


### Stripping
Using a golden axe on a log, wood block, or block of bamboo turns it into a stripped log, stripped wood, or block of stripped bamboo, respectively. This costs 1 point of durability of the axe.

#### Copper blocks
Using a golden axe on a waxed or oxidized copper block removes the wax if it has any, or otherwise remove a level of oxidization. This costs 1 point of durability.

### Weapon
When used as a weapon, a golden axe loses 2 durability points.

#### Java Edition
Attacking a shield user with an axe disables the use of the shield for 5 seconds. Vindicators, piglin brutes, or other mobs with commands always disable the player's shield. Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a sword of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to recover, resulting in lower DPS.

| Attack Damage | Attack Speed | Recovery time           | DPS | Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------------|-----|-----------------------------------|
| 7             | 1.0          | 1 second (20game ticks) | 7.0 | 112× 56                           |


↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.
