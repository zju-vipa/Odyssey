## Obtaining
### Breaking
To remove a painting from a wall, the player can attack it, break one of its supporting blocks, cover one square of it with a block, hit it with an arrow, egg, ender pearl, snowball, or fire charge, or subject it to an explosion. The painting then drops as an item. Arrows that hit paintings disappear.

### Crafting
| Ingredients   | Crafting recipe |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Stick+AnyWool |                 |

Paintings can be crafted with any color of wool. The color of the wool used does not influence the picture chosen when the painting is placed.
Once placed, it displays a random painting.

### Trading
Master-level shepherd villagers sell 3 paintings for 2 emeralds.

## Usage
### Placement
Paintings can be placed on the sides of solid blocks, signs, banners, or sculk veins. A small gap is visible between the painting and attachment surface. There are several different sizes of paintings (see below). When placed, a painting checks for the largest amount of space it has. It then chooses a random painting of that size. The player can add blocks around the painting to ensure it is the size wanted. When the supporting blocks are removed, the painting breaks after 20 game ticks (1 second) if no supporting blocks are replaced during that interval.

### Properties
Being an entity, paintings can simultaneously exist in the same space as blocks such as water or torches. Specifically, they can share the space with any block whose collision box does not intersect its hitbox.

Players and mobs are able to walk through paintings, as long as the blocks supporting the painting allow it. Secret doorways can be created this way. Light propagates through paintings as well.

If a player is concealed behind a painting, the player's name is also concealed from other players.[verify]

Paintings are non-flammable.

## Canvases
There are 26 (31 ‌[upcoming: BE 1.21.0]) paintings in the game. These are mostly based on paintings by Kristoffer Zetterstrand, who also created the Minecraft versions.
