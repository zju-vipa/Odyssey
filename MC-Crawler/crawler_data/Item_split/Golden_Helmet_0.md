A helmet can be repaired in an anvil by adding gold ingots, with each ingot restoring 25% the helmet's maximum durability, rounded down. Two golden helmets can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the helmet's enchantments.

↑ a b All enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.


### Mob loot
If a zombie, husk, stray or skeleton is wearing armor, there is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop a helmet upon death. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.

## Usage
Helmets can be placed in the top armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.

### Defense points
Defense points are each signified by half of a shirt of mail in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

Golden helmet adds 2 () defense points.

### Durability
Golden helmet can absorb 77 damage before being destroyed.

Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits helmets can endure.
