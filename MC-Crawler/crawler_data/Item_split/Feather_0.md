## Obtaining
### Mob loot
Adult chickens drop 0–2 feathers upon death. The maximum is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0–5 with Looting III.

Parrots drop 1–2 feathers upon death. The maximum is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 1–5 with Looting III.

A fox sometimes spawns holding a feather, which always drops upon death. Alternatively, the player can drop a food item, causing the fox to drop the feather in favor of the food.

Expert-level fletcher villagers buy 24 feathers for an emerald as part of their trade.
