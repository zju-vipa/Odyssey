## Obtaining
### Mob loot
Each rabbit has a 10% chance to drop a rabbit's foot when killed by the player. This chance can be increased by 3% per level using a sword enchanted with Looting.

A fox sometimes spawns with a rabbit's foot in its mouth, which always drops upon death. Alternatively, the player can drop a food item, which causes the fox to drop the rabbit's foot.
