Repair & NameDamaged Iron Pickaxe
An iron pickaxe can be repaired in an anvil by adding iron ingots, with each ingot restoring 25% of the pickaxe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two iron pickaxes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the pickaxe's enchantments.

↑ a b Enchantment probabilities are the same as a level-20 to level-39 enchantment would be on an enchantment table that had no cap at level 30, and that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.


### Mob loot
In Bedrock Edition, pillagers and vindicators have a chance of dropping a damaged iron pickaxe when killed during a raid. The pickaxe has a 50% chance of being enchanted with random enchantment(s).

### Trading
In Bedrock Edition, journeyman-level toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell enchanted iron pickaxes for 3 emeralds.

In Java Edition, journeyman-level toolsmith villagers have a 40% chance to sell an enchanted iron pickaxe for 7–22 emeralds.

The enchantments are the same as the ones obtained from an enchantment table at levels 5–19.

## Usage
Main article: Pickaxe § Usage
### Mining
An iron pickaxe is used to break stone and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with an iron pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as torches and flowers.

An iron pickaxe or better is required to mine the following blocks:

- Block of Diamond
- Block of Emerald
- Block of Gold
- Block of Raw Gold
- Deepslate Diamond Ore
- Deepslate Emerald Ore
- Deepslate Gold Ore
- Diamond Ore
- Emerald Ore
- Gold Ore
- Redstone Ore

### Weapon
#### Java Edition
All pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take about 0.83 seconds to recover. Iron pickaxes do 4 damage per attack, or 4.8 damage per second.

#### Bedrock Edition
All pickaxes attack instantly, with iron pickaxes doing 5 damage per attack.

### Enchantments
An iron pickaxe can receive the following enchantments:
