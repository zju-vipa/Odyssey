### Fishing
Name tags can be caught from fishing as part of the treasure category with a 1⁄6 chance after the 5% chance of being a treasure catch. The chance of catching treasure increases with the Luck of the Sea enchantment.

### Trading
Master-level librarian villagers offer to sell a name tag for 20 emeralds as one of their available trades.

## Usage
To use a name tag, it must first be renamed with an anvil, costing 1 experience level. 

If it is not renamed, it has no effect when used on a mob. After the name tag is renamed, the player can use it on a mob to give it the name given to the name tag from the anvil. Mobs and name tags can be renamed any number of times. Name tags with the same name are stackable. 

Once a mob is named, it keeps its name, and the name tag is consumed.

When a mob is named, it is excluded from the mob cap count.

Effects on various mobs:

- A namedsilverfishthat goes into a block appears to lose its name because it is replaced by a newly generated unnamed silverfish when the block is broken.
- A baby (animal or villager) keeps its name when becoming an adult.
	- A namedvillagerkeeps its name when transformed into azombie villager.
	- A named zombie villager keeps its name when cured.
- Wandering tradersstill despawn even if they are named, or in aminecartorboat.
- A namedwither's boss bar displays its name instead of "Wither".
- Naming anender dragonwith commands also displays the name in the boss bar.

### Limitations
Any mob can be named except for the ender dragon and agents. Players can also not be named.

A name tag can rename an armor stand, though it does not show the nameplate above its head until CustomNameVisible:1b is set as an extra step.

Using a name tag on a villager renames the villager instead of opening the trading interface. A saddled pig is renamed instead of being ridden. Using a name tag on any other mob that can be interacted with performs the use action instead of being named. These mobs can be renamed if the player uses the name tag while crouching or standing in a nether portal because the portal suppresses the use action.

Once a name tag is used on a mob, it is impossible to remove the name of that mob without the use of commands or external modifications.

### Behavior
Renamed mobs have their name displayed over their head in the same fashion as a mob named through a renamed spawn egg. Their names can be seen only if they are aimed at from four or fewer blocks away.

Mobs that are named using the name tag never despawn in the world, similar to tamed mobs.[1] The exceptions are wandering traders or if the mob is hostile and the difficulty is switched to "Peaceful", causing any hostile mobs or any named hostile mobs to despawn immediately. 

If a renamed mob kills a player, the custom name is used in the death message in place of the mob type name. For instance, if a vindicator named "Johnny" kills a player, the death message is "Player was slain by Johnny". 

A renamed wither also has a renamed health bar, and the boss bar doesn't regenerate[verify].

### Easter eggs
- Any mob that receives the name "Dinnerbone" or "Grumm" is rendered upside down. This even includes the player in early versions of Bedrock Edition if the username is set to either of these and you are not signed into Xbox Live.
- Naming asheep"jeb_" causes its wool to fade between the dye colors, producing a rainbow effect. Thewoolthat drops when the sheep isshearedor killed is the original color of the sheep before the sheep was named.
- Naming arabbit"Toast" causes it to have a special memorial skin of user xyzen420's girlfriend'smissing rabbit.
- Naming avindicator"Johnny" causes it to be aggressive and attack allmobsincluding the wither (exceptghastsand otherillagers). The hostility even extends toravagersinJava Edition, as the "Johnny" vindicator can also attack the ravager while it's riding it.
