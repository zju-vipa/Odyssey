## Obtaining
### Picking up arrows
Main article: Arrow § Picking up arrows
Similarly to regular arrows, players can pick up spectral arrows that have been shot by dispensers, or other players in Survival or Adventure mode. Unlike regular arrows, spectral arrows shot by an Infinity-enchanted bow can be picked up, as they are not affected by the enchantment.

### Chest loot
| Item           | Structure       | Container      | Quantity | Chance       |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------|--------------|

### Bartering
Spectral arrows can be obtained through bartering with piglins, and have a ~8.71% chance to give the player 6-12 arrows.

## Usage
Main article: Arrow § Common properties
Spectral arrows share many of the same characteristics as regular arrows as projectiles. See Arrow#Common properties for information on common properties shared by all arrows. 

### Special properties
A spectral arrow confers the Glowing status effect for 10 seconds. The Glowing effect creates an outline of the target, which is visible through blocks, and colored based on the target's team (white by default). Even if a bow is enchanted with Infinity, spectral arrows are still consumed.
