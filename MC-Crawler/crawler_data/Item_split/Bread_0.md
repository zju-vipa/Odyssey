### Trading
Novice-level farmer villagers sell 6 bread for one emerald as part of their trades. In Java Edition they only have a 40% chance of offering this trade.

### Villager gifts
Farmer villagers may use wheat they have harvested to craft bread, which they can trade with other villagers.

Farmer villagers may throw bread at players under the Hero of the Village effect.‌[Java Edition  only]

## Usage
### Food
See also: Hunger management

Bread can be eaten with the use control while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating bread restores 5 () hunger and 6.0 hunger saturation.

### Breeding
Villagers can pick up bread items to become willing, allowing them to breed. Villagers require 3 bread to become willing.

### Composting
Placing bread into a composter has an 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1. It is more efficient to compost wheat than bread made from wheat.
