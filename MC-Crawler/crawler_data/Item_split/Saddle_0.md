## Obtaining
### Mob loot
Any mob that the player equips with a saddle drops the saddle upon death.

A strider may spawn being ridden by a zombified piglin, which causes it to spawn wearing a saddle. This saddle always drops when the strider is killed.

A ravager always spawns with a saddle and always drops the saddle upon death. Looting does not affect the drop.

### Fishing
Saddles can be obtained as a "treasure" item from fishing with a base chance (without fishing rod enchantments) of 0.8%.

### Trading
Master-level leatherworker villagers have a 50% chance to sell a saddle for 6 emeralds as their trade.‌[Bedrock Edition  only] This trade is always offered in Java Edition.

## Usage
A horse equipped with a saddle.
While camels, horses, donkeys, mules and skeleton horses‌[Java Edition  only] can always be ridden, a saddle is required to control them. These mobs (only after being tamed, in the case of equine mobs) can be equipped with a saddle by placing it in their inventory, which can be opened by pressing use while holding a saddle or sneaking. The saddle can be unequipped by removing it from  the specific inventory slot. 

Saddles are required to ride pigs and striders, but even with a saddle their movement cannot be controlled like other mobs. A carrot on a stick (for pigs) or a warped fungus on a stick (for striders) is required to direct these mobs. Using a saddle on one of these mobs equips them with the saddle, and, since they have no inventory, there is no way to retrieve the saddle without killing the mob.

Animals can also be equipped with saddles by a dispenser.

Although ravagers are equipped with saddles and sometimes ridden by other mobs, the player is unable to ride ravagers.
