### Natural generation
Moss carpets generate naturally in lush caves and mangrove swamps.


### Crafting
| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Moss Block  | 3               |

### Post-generation
Using bone meal on a moss block has a 25% chance to grow moss carpets.

Mangrove propagules that grow into mangrove trees can generate moss carpets on their roots.

## Usage
Moss carpet has most of the properties of the standard carpet, except that it is not flammable, cannot be pushed by pistons, cannot be equipped on llamas, and does not occlude vibrations. 

### Composting
Placing a moss carpet into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

### Piston interactivity
Moss carpets break when pushed by pistons. They cannot be pulled by sticky pistons.
