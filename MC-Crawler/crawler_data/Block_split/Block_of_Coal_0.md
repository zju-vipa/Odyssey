## Obtaining
### Breaking
Blocks of coal can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

### Natural generation
Blocks of coal can generate in trail ruins.

### Crafting
Blocks of coal can be crafted only from regular coal, not charcoal. It is crafted in the same way as other mineral blocks.

## Usage
Blocks of coal are often used to store coal in a compact fashion, or otherwise used as a fairly cheap construction block.

### Fuel
Blocks of coal can be used as fuel in a furnace. One block of coal lasts 800 seconds (16000 ticks), which smelts 80 items. This is ten times the duration of a single piece of coal and 11⁄9 times as efficient (+11.11%) as nine individual pieces of coal, which would only smelt 72 items. The latter, however, prevents inactive furnace use; while smelting one item with one coal wastes seven potential items, smelting one item with one block of coal wastes 79 potential items.

### Note blocks
Block of coal can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass drum" sounds.
