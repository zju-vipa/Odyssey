# Planks
Planks are common blocks used as building blocks and in crafting recipes. They are one of the first things that a player can craft in Survival and Adventure modes. There are eleven variants of planks, which can be differentiated into three categories: Overworld planks made from tree logs, bamboo planks made from blocks of bamboo, and nonflammable Nether planks made from huge fungus stems.

## Usage
Planks can be used to build structures, craft ingredients, or as fuel for smelting. Crimson planks and warped planks, however, cannot be used as fuel; the player has to convert them into tools, sticks, or other things.

### Crafting ingredient
Planks are used in many crafting recipes. Stairs, slabs, fences, fence gates, doors, trapdoors, pressure plates, buttons, signs, and boats must be crafted from planks of the same type, and the crafted result depends on the type used. For other products, planks of different types can be mixed freely and the wood types in the product is indeterminate. Crimson and warped planks cannot be used to make boats.[2]
