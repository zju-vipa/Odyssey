## Usage
Main articles: Trapdoor § Usage and Trapdoor uses
### Properties
Iron trapdoors can only be toggled by a redstone signal.

### Barrier
Opening and closing an iron trapdoor requires redstone to do it. When a trapdoor opens or closes, it immediately changes its orientation without affecting anything in the space it "passes through".

### Redstone component
See also: Redstone circuit

Iron trapdoors can be controlled with redstone power. An iron trapdoor is a redstone mechanism and can be activated by weakly powering any cardinally adjacent block.

When activated, the iron trapdoor immediately opens. When deactivated, it immediately closes.
