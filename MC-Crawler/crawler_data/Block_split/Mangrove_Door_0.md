## Obtaining
Wooden doors can be crafted from any type of planks, including those found in the Nether. Different types of wooden doors can also be found in multiple structures in the Overworld.

### Breaking
Wooden doors can be broken with anything, but axes are fastest. Wooden doors drop themselves if they no longer have a block beneath them that can support them.

| Block     | Wooden Door           |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| Hardness  | 3                     |
| Tool      |                       |
|           | Breakingtime (sec)[A] |
| Default   | 4.5                   |
| Wooden    | 2.25                  |
| Stone     | 1.15                  |
| Iron      | 0.75                  |

↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.


Wooden doors require a solid block beneath them for support. if that block is no longer supporting, due to breaking or changing, the door will drop itself as an item.

Pistons can also break doors, pushing the piston head or any block into the door causes the door to break.

## Usage
Main article: Door § Usage
Wooden doors can be opened and closed using a redstone signal, or by players, villagers, piglins, wandering traders‌[BE  only], and vindicators‌[JE  only]. Wooden doors are also affected by the wind burst of thrown wind charges‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0], causing them to open if closed, or vice versa.

In Hard difficulty, wooden doors can be broken by vindicators and all variants of zombies except drowned.

Some doors have built-in openings that are useful for determining the time of day. Regardless of this, all wooden doors allow light to pass through them.

### Barrier
A wooden door can be opened or closed by pressing the Use Item/Place Block control. When a door opens or closes, it immediately changes its orientation without affecting anything in the space it "swings through".

Some zombies can break wooden doors in Hard difficulty. Zombies have a 5% chance to spawn with the ability to break doors. Vindicators spawned from a raid in Normal and Hard difficulty can also break wooden doors, but they do so only to reach targeted players, villagers, or wandering traders. In Java Edition, some vindicators may sometimes open a wooden door instead of breaking it. Both zombies and vindicators attempt to break a wooden door only when the door is in its "closed" state; this is the case even when the door is placed in such a way as to allow passage in its "closed" state and block passage in its "open" state (for example, by facing sideways when placing the door).
