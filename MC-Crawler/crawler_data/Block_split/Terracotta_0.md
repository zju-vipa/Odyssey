## Obtaining

### Natural generation
Badlands

Uncolored terracotta can be found naturally in badlands biomes, which yield massive amounts of terracotta.

Villages

Uncolored terracotta can be found in mason houses in plains villages and in some desert village houses, lamps and meeting points.

Others

Uncolored terracotta can be found in trail ruins.


### Smelting
| Ingredients  | Smelting recipe |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Clay+Anyfuel | 0.35            |

## Usage
### Building
Terracotta has the same blast resistance as most other stone blocks, which is significantly higher than the block of clay before being smelted. A block of terracotta when one block away from a creeper or TNT explosion protects any blocks behind it, although the terracotta itself is destroyed.
