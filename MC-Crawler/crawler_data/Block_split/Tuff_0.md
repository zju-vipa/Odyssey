### Natural generation
A tuff blob.
See also: Ore (feature)

Tuff can generate in the Overworld in the form of ore blobs. Tuff attempts to generate 2 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-864, from elevations -64 to 0, in all biomes. Tuff can replace stone, andesite, diorite, granite, and deepslate. Any ore that generates in tuff becomes its deepslate variety.

Additionally, tuff can generate in an ore vein that consists of iron ore below Y=0.
