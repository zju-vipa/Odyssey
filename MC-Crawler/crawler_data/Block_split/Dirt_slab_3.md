Three creatures were present in the MINECON Earth 2017 vote. One was a sea creature known as "Mob A, The Monster of the Ocean Depths", or the barnacle. It would have spawned in deep water and attacked players with a tentacle-like tongue to pull players down and drown them.

Another was "Mob C, The Great Hunger." It would have had a large mouth capable of removing enchantments from items and would have camouflaged itself by entering the ground with its mouth open upward. Jeb mentioned that the mob wouldn't have been aggressive, only damaging the player if they accidentally fell into its mouth, and it wouldn't have stripped enchantments from players' items unless players fed it intentionally.[41] Its functionality was eventually replaced by the grindstone.

The other mob was "Mob D, The Hovering Inferno." It would have looked like a large blaze with shields instead of rods, and would have spawned with groups of blazes in the nether. This mob however appears in the Minecraft Dungeons DLC Flames of the Nether, and the board game Minecraft: Portal Dash, under the name "Wildfire".

Mob B, the Monster of the Night Skies, was the phantom, which won the vote and was added in the Update Aquatic.[42]

- Mob A, Monster of the Ocean Depths
- Mob C, the Great Hunger
- Mob D, the Hovering Inferno

In September 2018, a poll was held in which Chinese users could vote on which "national treasure" they thought would be added to Minecraft, to promote the release of Minecraft China. There were five options: giant panda, Chinese alligator, snub-nosed monkey, white-lipped deer, or baiji.[43] It was stated on Minecraft Feedback[44] that alligators and/or crocodiles, if implemented into the game, would likely not be hostile mobs as, like the shark (which was outright rejected), hostile mobs had to be fantasy creatures. It is unknown whether any of these mobs will be added.

According to a now taken down tweet by Aubrey Norris, Microsoft’s Senior Manager, this vote had no bearing whatsoever.[45]

- Chinese alligator
- Snub-nosed monkey
- White-lipped deer
- Baiji
