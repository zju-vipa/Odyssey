## About zombie villagers
Zombie villagers have a 5% chance to spawn in place of a regular zombie and can also spawn if a zombie kills a regular villager, depending on the difficulty level. (0% on Easy, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard)

You can also spawn zombie villagers via commands or using a spawn egg.

A villager and a zombie villager always spawn inside an igloo basement. Zombie villagers also naturally generate in zombie villages.

Zombie villagers have a similar appearance to normal villagers but have zombie-colored flesh and attempt to attack the player like other zombies.

In Bedrock Edition, zombie villagers also have a 5% chance to emerge from zombie spawners, and you can contrive to separate the zombie villagers from the zombies to collect them and heal them.

in Java Edition zombie villagers do not spawn from zombie monster spawners, so don't expect to get a zombie villager by waiting next to a monster spawner.

## Finding and crafting the equipment
### Splash Potion of Weakness
To create a Splash Potion of Weakness, it must be brewed using a brewing stand, which can either be crafted using blaze rods and cobblestone or found in an igloo basement, end ship or a cleric house in a village.

- To brew a Splash Potion of Weakness, you need:
	- 1fermented spider eye, which can be crafted withspider eyes,brown mushroomandsugar
	- 1 to 3water bottles, which can be obtained by right-clicking awater sourcewithglass bottles
	- 1gunpowder, which can be obtained fromcreepersandghastsor found in naturally-generated chests
	- 1blaze powderto fuel the brewing stand

Place the water bottle(s) and the fermented spider eye in the brewing stand, then insert the blaze powder in the fuel slot to initiate the brewing process. Once your potions of weakness have brewed, place in the gunpowder to convert them into splash potions of weakness.

A splash potion of weakness can also be found placed in igloo brewing stands.

### Lingering Potion of Weakness
To create a Lingering Potion of Weakness, it must be brewed using a brewing stand.

- To brew a Lingering Potion of Weakness, you need:
	- 1fermented spider eye, which can be crafted withspider eyes,brown mushroom, andsugar
	- 1 to 3water bottles, which can be obtained by right-clicking awater sourcewithglass bottles
	- 1gunpowder, which can be obtained fromcreepersandghastsor found in naturally-generated chests
	- 1dragon's breath, which can be obtained by scooping up theender dragon's breath attack ordragon fireballclouds in anempty bottle
	- 1blaze powderto fuel the brewing stand

Place the three water bottles and the fermented spider eye in the brewing stand, then insert the blaze powder to initiate the brewing process. Once your potions of weakness have brewed, place in the gunpowder to convert them into splash potions of weakness. Once your splash potions of weakness have brewed, place in the dragon's breath to convert them into lingering potions.

### Arrow of Weakness
An Arrow of Weakness can provide an alternative to splash potions of weakness and eliminate the risk of splashing yourself with the weakness potion; however, they are harder to obtain than splash potions.

To craft arrows of weakness, you must brew a lingering potion of weakness, which can be done by brewing a Splash Potions of Weakness with dragon's breath.

- Dragon's breath can be obtained by right-clicking (or long-pressing if in Bedrock Edition) theender dragondragon breath or dragon fireball clouds with an empty glass bottle in hand.
- Combine eight arrows and a Lingering Potion of Weakness in a crafting table, and craft eight Arrows of Weakness.

Alternatively, there are multiple methods to obtain arrows of weakness without having to fight the ender dragon:

- Arrows of weakness can be obtained by filing acauldronwith a Potion of Weakness and thenusingarrows on it. A full cauldron can treat the tips of a stack of arrows.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- Arrows of weakness can be obtained through trades with master level fletcher villager.
- If the player has theHero of the Villageeffect, fletcher villagers can throw arrows of weakness as gifts to the player.{Java Edition only}

### Witch
Witches have a 25% chance of throwing a splash potion of weakness if the player is within 3 blocks of a witch and does not already have the Weakness status effect. While this method is more dangerous to attempt than others, this method can be used as an alternative if a player is not able to obtain a potion or arrow of weakness at the time.

Witches spawn in numerous ways, including:

- In theOverworldat the light level of 0. It spawns in all Overworldbiomesexceptmushroom fieldsanddeep dark.
- In aswamp hutlocated inswampbiomes.
- When an adult or babyvillageris within 4 blocks of a lightning strike.
- Inraidsstarting from wave 4 inBedrock Edition, or wave 3 or 4 inJava Editiondepending on theworld difficulty.

### Golden Apple

Golden apples are crafted from eight gold ingots and an apple in a crafting table.

They can also naturally generate in:

- stronghold altars
- large underwater ruin chests
- dungeon chests
- desert pyramid chests
- mineshaft minecart chests
- woodland mansion chests
- igloo chests
- ruined portal chests
- ancient city center chest

## Finding a zombie villager
Zombie villagers spawn in place of a normal zombie 5% of the time and can also be found in igloo basements and zombie villages. Manually scouting your base's perimeter during the night is a good way to find zombie villagers.

If you cannot find a zombie villager, you can summon them via commands or use a spawn egg if you have cheats on.

In Bedrock Edition zombie villagers have the same 5% chance to emerge from a zombie spawner as they have of spawning naturally on the Overworld surface. This makes zombie villager farming possible.

## Curing a zombie villager
1. Prepare before the curing process by taking off yourThornsenchanted armor (if your armor isn't enchanted with Thorns don't worry about that) and put away anything that might hurt the zombie villager, such as splash healing potions. Try to keep your golden apples next to your splash/lingering weakness potions or your bow if you're using weakness arrows, since you might forget your golden apples and the zombie villager loses the weakness effect by the time you find the apple. Grab a shield with a durability above half so you can block the attacks more safely. If you're planning to use weakness arrows, use an unenchanted bow since enchanted bows mostly deal more damage to the zombie villager. Make your tamed wolves sit and move youriron golemsaway from the zombie villager. Make sure you don't heal the zombie villager in the middle of araidbecause the raidingillagersmight attack the newly-cured villager. Try to keep your health above half because the zombie villager might kill you if you have too little health. Now after the preparing is complete and you had turned off most of your defenses, go find a zombie villager in any of the places stated above.
2. When you find a zombie villager, lure the zombie villager and secure it in a safe area that no hostile mobs can break into (make it following you it is best, and try to use a door to secure it), in case a zombie kills or infects the newly-cured villager, making you lose your hard work and patience. Make sure to include a roof of opaque blocks so the zombie villager does not burn when the night ends. Also, it's best not to heal multiple zombie villagers at a time (unless you can feed all of them a golden apple around the same time, or if they're sealed in separate areas) because if one zombie villager is healed, other zombie villagers attack that villager and turn it back into a zombie villager.
3. Select theSplash Potion of Weakness, use your bow if you are using anArrow of Weakness(don't enchant your bow withPowerorFlameor else it might kill the zombie villager), or lure awitchclose to the zombie villager or vice versa. Don't worry about the zombie villager attacking the witch after the witch threw the weakness potion because the witch's potions (except weakness and slowness) do nothing to the zombie villager (poison does nothing to the zombie villager because the zombie villager is immune to poison and harming heals the zombie villager since it's an undead mob).
4. Throw the splash/lingering potion or shoot the tipped arrow at the zombie villager from a distance. Or stand within 3 blocks of the witch and the zombie villager until the witch throws a splash potion of weakness. If done correctly, the zombie villager should have gray swirls emanating from it; this means that the zombie villager is currently inflicted withweakness, which, as it is an undead mob, gives it lives (giving "live energy" so to say, the first part of the cure).
5. Feed the zombie villager thegolden apple, done by facing the zombie villager and pressing theusekey. If done correctly, the zombie villager emits red particles and starts shaking. Note that iron bars and beds speed up the curing process. Keep the zombie villager safe at this point and don't attack it.
6. After 3 to 5 minutes have elapsed, the zombie villager converts into a normal villager. If you found your zombie villager in an igloo basement or a zombie village, you have to transport them, likely viaboats,minecarts, upwardbubble columns(soul sand and water),nether portals, or other ways of manual movement, as villagers cannot be leashed unlike other mobs. You can also push the villager onto the ladder to make it climb up. Make sure you bring the villager's job site blocks if you're in an igloo!

Curing a zombie villager grants you the Zombie Doctor achievement/advancement if it has not been obtained yet. If the cured villager has a profession, it permanently provides heavy discounts while trading to the player that cured them.‌[Java Edition  only] There is also a heavy discount on Bedrock Edition with 1.16, another thing to keep in mind is that in Bedrock Edition, the discount spreads through the "talking" of villagers 16 blocks in a cube from the cured Villager.
