## Basics
Advancements are tasks to complete, meant to help guide players in advancing further into the game. Some of the more advanced advancements will also give you experience as a reward. Advancements are organized into five categories, which appear in separate tabs: Minecraft, Nether, The End, Adventure, and Husbandry.

Even though many advancements have parents and are parents of other advancements, it does not matter which order you complete the advancements; the parents of advancements are just a guide of the easiest order to work through the advancements. For example, the advancement "Husbandry" is the parent of "The Parrots and the Bats", but this does not mean that "Husbandry" must be completed before "The Parrots and the Bats". Each advancement is independent of one another, despite them having parents.

It should also be noted that it is not practical, or in some cases impossible, to complete these advancements in tab-by-tab order. For example, entering the end portal, which is the last advancement in the Minecraft tab, is impossible on a normal seed without going to the Nether first.

Because of how many advancements Minecraft has in modern versions, one page would be too long for all of them. Thus, the guide was split into 5 pages, one for each tab:

## Minecraft
