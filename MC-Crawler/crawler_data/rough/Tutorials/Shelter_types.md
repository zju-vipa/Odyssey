## Organization
These shelters are organized by how long it would take to build them. Obviously, these can vary, depending on how detailed you make them. Material collection time counts too!

### Nomadic
The easiest type of shelter to build. These are generally the type you would build if you cannot find anything else, if you are nomadic, or if you're in an emergency. They are fragile and you shouldn't spend too many nights in them. They take a few minutes to make.

### Easy
These structures are a little bigger and more advanced than nomadic shelters. They offer some basic degree of protection. They may take a bit longer to make than Nomadic shelters.

### Medium
These are freestanding structures, capable of sustaining the player for extended periods. They offer a decent amount of protection. They take 1-3 Minecraft days to make. 

### Hard
These structures are often large and complicated in design and, as a result, can be time-consuming to make. However, they offer anywhere from a good degree to a great deal of protection. They take anywhere from a few Minecraft days to many days to make. 

### Extreme
This category of structures are renowned for being among the most complex and advanced constructions that a Survival mode player can afford and take a long time to build and can, therefore, be considered late-game buildings. The protection offered by these building complexes is second to none. They will take longer than Hard shelters and in some cases, you will spend in total a real-world day to create.

### Innovative
These structures focus more on feats of engineering rather than practicality and therefore offer relatively little protection relative to how challenging they are to build and many of them can even be dangerous to live in. They are, however, a sight worth looking at. These will take a varied amount of time to build, so you may not be ready to do these unless you have a large amount of time.

### Addons and renovations
While not full structures themselves, they are worth mentioning since they can be used to augment existing shelters.





















## Nomadic
### General tips
"Nomadic Shelters" are usually crude, primitive, and simple in design relative to other more advanced shelter types, often being the bare minimum of what qualifies as a shelter. They are, however, cheap and easy to build and can be constructed and set up almost anywhere, making them suitable shelters for use during the first, second and third days of Minecraft, for nomadic players or as an emergency fall-back solution in dire situations.

### Advantages
- Usually a portable shelter by design
- Easy to dismantle and rebuild
- Materials can be easily obtained and carried around

### Disadvantages
- Offers limited protection and is extremely vulnerable tocreeperattacks
- Many designs do not allow the player to easily tell when it is safe to go outside
- Usually vulnerable to spider attacks

### Tips
- Always have proper lighting
- Build basic fortifications (fences, walls, etc.) if necessary or desired
- Have a door and windows, if resources allow that
- Just because a nomadic shelter is crude, primitive and simple in design doesn't mean it cannot serve as the base and foundation for a more advanced shelter if the player, for example, decides to end their nomadic travel, settle down and adopt a more sedentary lifestyle.

### Emergency shelter
Materials[edit | edit source]
- None

### Description
The simplest, yet the fastest possible shelter can be made by digging 3 blocks straight down and then capping off the hole with a block of the player's choosing, like dirt for instance. This requires only a few seconds. While digging straight down like this is never recommended, it is highly unlikely to run into a cave when digging only 3 blocks from the surface. It is relatively safe to expand the shelter from thereon. This type of shelter can be done also when your base is already established, but you are caught by the night while far away from your base. This method is safer than it seems; zombies, skeletons, creepers, endermen and spiders cannot get in. A problem is getting out however; it is a possibility for the player to dig out of the base straight into hostile mobs such as creepers. One way to fix this is to build a little hut above it. This is not permanent; it is advised to seek a more sophisticated shelter after a few nights. Diagram below: To avoid mob spawning when sleeping through the night is impossible due to a lack of wool, one can light up their base using torches.

or you can expand it like this:

Location

Extras

- Torches
- Bed
- Ladders (For getting out)

### Boat Shelter
Note: This shelter type will only work properly in ocean biomes.

### Materials
- 5 wooden planks of the same type
- A crafting table

| Ingredients              | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| MatchingOverworld Planks |                 |

Description

Since most hostile mobs cannot spawn in liquid, it is possible to use a boat to survive your first night (note that drowned can spawn in water). If you are stuck on a small island out in the middle of an ocean with few (if any) resources around, a boat could be your salvation if you can find enough wood for it and the crafting table required in its creation. For this shelter to work properly, you should stay at least 42 blocks away from the beaches at night to prevent any hostile mobs from spotting you. If you need quick food, craft a fishing rod. Your hunger also does not deplete in a boat.





Operation time:
It should preferably not be used longer than 1-3 Minecraft days (unless you like being nomadic).

Advantages

- Easy to craft, requires only 9 wooden planks.
- Mobile, can easily be moved from one place to another.
- Since you are in the water, you will be always safe from endermen (and other hostile mobs will have a hard time reaching you).
- You can use a bow to snipe hostile mobs from the water with little to no chance of retaliation, then collect their drops at dawn.
- Food can be obtained through fishing.
- If you have to cross an ocean, you could spend the night doing that instead just going to sleep in abed.

Disadvantages

- Works only in oceans.
- Offers evasion, but no protection.
- You will eventually be forced to make your way to the mainland to resupply on resources.
- You cannot use crafting tables, furnaces, chests or anything similar without finding solid ground.
- Fishingis not a reliable source of food in the long run.
- Requires you to disembark from the boat and to proceed on foot if you have to cross the solid ground.
- If askeletondestroys the boat (which is likely to happen if you get too close), you will have to quickly replace it to avoid drowning.

### Cocooning
Description
Like how a caterpillar surrounds itself with a cocoon in order to undergo metamorphosis, this shelter involves simply surrounding yourself with a certain material to shelter yourself from the dark. 

Materials

- At its smallest, just 9-13 blocks of a chosen material
- The recommended build size requires 25 blocks

Structure: (As seen from the ground upwards)

Note that the door here is to denote the "entrance" (that is, the blocks you break in order to get into and out of the cocoon.

Location
Anywhere

Extras

- Torches
- A door
- Windows (can be made with fences)
- Basic fortifications (like fences and walls etc.)

### Crater Home
Materials

- Creeper (if no basin already exists)
- Alternatively, TNT

Description

Use a creeper-made (or TNT-caused) crater or stone basin as a temporary (or permanent, if you want) home. While easy to make, it is not recommended for a long-term stay unless expanded and upgraded.

Location

Anywhere with a crater/basin.

Construction

Either...

(Example 1)
Jump into the crater, and begin digging a 2 block high hole in the side (you may dig down 1-2 blocks if the crater is not deep enough) for the opening. Then go in and hollow out a small room inside of that. You may like to dig down a few more rooms, but it is not recommended if you have no lighting. Cover the opening with blocks (dirt or cobblestone works wonders.) 

or...

(Example 2)
If the crater/basin is small enough and you have enough blocks to allow it, cover the whole crater/basin with a roof made out of dirt, cobblestone, etc., but leave a small entry hole, jump into the crater/basin and block off the hole, then light up the interior. This gives you a slightly more spacious home, but it requires you to have enough blocks to build a roof to cover the whole crater/basin.

Extras

- Bed
- Torches
- A ladder to get out (example 2 only)

### Tree
Materials

Glass, wood logs, leaves, stairs, wood planks, 

Description

Inside a normal tree. It's a simple shelter and works best for emergencies, since it doesn't have much expansion possibilities in a short time(unless you put down some saplings and connect the trees).

Location

Anywhere with a tree or a sapling and bone meal and enough space.

Construction

Break the tree trunk and then use the wood logs to pillar jump up quickly until you are completely covered by leaves. Then put the 2 remaining blocks on opposite sides to avoid leaf decay and done, you got a practically perfect shelter that blends with the environment! You can get on top of the tree removing the logs and pillar jumping all the way up.

Extras

- More logs to avoid leaf decay.
- A torch.
- A crafting table, a furnace and a chest.
- The tree shelter can be converted into a treehouse.
- If you want more space, use a 2×2 grid of saplings to create a large Tree (does not work with all tree species)

### Cliff-side Cave
Materials

- A pickaxe
- (Optional) A shovel.
- (Optional) A sword, just in case you happen to run into an unexpected cave with mobs in it.


Description

A cliff-side cave is probably the most popular shelter for the first night. It takes only a few seconds to make, and once inside, the creator is safe to expand it. It also offers good protection against most mobs (excluding creepers, as they can blow up your rock walls). Since it's a structure inside the ground, building material will be gained instead of lost when expanding it.

Location

The most common location for this shelter is wherever you mined your first cobblestone or coal, simply expand the hole you made to make it livable and, WHAM! you got yourself a cliff-side shelter.
The best part of this shelter is that you can build it anywhere there's a cliff. Make sure there's a solid wall (preferably straight up). Mining down does not usually make a good shelter. A cliff by a large body of water is preferred as hostile mobs cannot spawn in the water. Also, try to find a place with coal for torches.

Construction
Extremely simple. Mine a 1×1×2 hole in the wall, then enter the hole and close it off. From there, you may start mining deeper.

Extras

- Torches
- Mine extension
- Link to an above-ground base
- Plenty of rations and tools in case you drop into another tunnel and find yourself trapped.



- Where to build a cliffside cave.
- Where not to build a cliffside cave.
- A 2×2×1 hole in the wall.
- A finished cliff-side cave.

### Village housing
Materials:

- At least around 6 torches
- A bed

Description:

Claim a village house for yourself and convert it into a home.

Location:

A village

Construction:

The first part is the hardest: first, find a village. 
Once you find a village, pick a house that you find suitable and claim it as your home, customize and upgrade at your leisure. 

If you're just trying to spend the night in the village, the plains temple, taiga temple, or one of desert small house (tower house) is usually the best choice, because the door keeps you safe (except that zombies may spawn inside during sieges, or break down the door in hard mode) and because the building has a tower, you can be safe from a surprise creeper attack in the morning. Just before exiting the building, double-check that there is no creeper nearby from the top of the tower. Then go outside and do your things.

One major downside is that if the player is within the village during night, this is likely going to attract the attention of zombies which can easily lead to the whole villager population being wiped out over time, due to several different factors. Also, if a player has the Bad Omen effect, then a raid can occur in the village and most likely will kill the villagers with the village, due some illagers being able to break or even open doors. 

If you want to protect the villagers, but do not have enough materials to build a wall around the village and light up the whole area, simply do the following:

- Collect as many materials as you can: You need torches and dirt.
- Thoroughly light up the interior of all houses that have doors on them to prevent hostile mob spawning
- Wait until all the villagers have gone indoors, then barricade the doors with a 1-2 block tall stack of dirt in front of the door.
	- The villagers will not be able to come out (and get into trouble) and zombies will not be able to get in (and kill the villagers)
		- This is for the villagers' own safety, their AI is woefully ill-equipped to deal with the dangers of the outside world.

Extras:

- Build a second floor (which some of the houses already come with)
- Add furniture (which some of the buildings come with)
- Occupy the whole village! The buildings that have a chance of being generated in the village include the library, which includes bookshelves (which you can later mine using theSilk Touchenchantment), other buildings which also have bookshelves; one of snowy tundra medium house (house made of wood) and one of taiga medium house (medium house without furnace). Some small houses also have a crafting table. There's also the weaponsmith shop, which comes with furnaces; 2 furnaces for plains, desert and one of savanna weaponsmith (weaponsmith with smooth stone), but there is no furnace in taiga and snowy taiga weaponsmith, however, one of taiga medium house has a single furnace, also, furnaces can be found in many houses if you are in snowy tundra village. A small pool of lava can be found in plains, desert, snowy taiga, and savanna village weaponsmith (taiga and snowy taiga village has no lava), and many buildings have a chest of goodies. The plains temple (which looks like a classic church) is a two-story building, and you can use the tower and roof to look over the entire village, alternatively one of desert village small house, which looks like a tower can also be used if you are in desert village, due it being the tallest building in village, consist of staircase with 4 windows hole (1 window hole each floor).
- Light up and build a wall around the village to ensure that you (and the inhabitants) will be safe while going from house to house.
- No need to put a crafting table or furnace in your house! If there is a building with a crafting table and a building with a furnace, the aforementioned blocks can be retrieved from there, just build a house with a bed (beds in villages are claimed by villagers, so you need to make one for yourself) and a chest (some buildings have chests orbarrels, which can be used as storage). Some buildings also havesmokers,blast furnaces, orcampfires(within taiga and snowy taiga villages). When you get an enchantment table, place more bookshelves in the library, then place the enchantment table.

### Desert Temple
Materials

- At least 15 torches
- 5 doors
- A trapdoor
- Ladders

Description

Desert Temples are not only good shelters, but also contain worthwhile loot such as emeralds, diamonds, gold, iron, and bones, but do look out for the secret chamber with a pressure plate and the 3×3 grid of TNT!

Location

Desert Temple, found exclusively in desert biomes.

Construction

- Find a Desert Temple. They usually spawn in deserts and can sometimes even be found near NPC Villages.
- (MUST be done first). Get some torches, a pickaxe, and some ladders and dig straight down 2 blocks outside the blue stained clay in the center, be careful not to activate the pressure plate.
- Destroy the pressure plate and take the loot from the chest and the TNT under the sandstone.
- Use ladders to get back up. You can use the underground chest room later as a room or expand from using the 1×1×2 spaces where the chests were as doorways.
- Light up the entire structure using torches.
- Add a door at the front, the 2 hallways to the 2 towers on either side and to the 2 doorways near the top of the pyramid.
- Add a ladder for easy access to the second floor above the stained clay.
- Add a trapdoor onto the hole above the blue stained clay.
- Add any necessary items such as chests, beds, Crafting tables, and furnaces.

Extras

- Add some fences around the walkways on the pyramid roof to keep any hostile mobs at bay.
- Build walls around the entire temple and light up the exterior to fortify it further
- Expand the lower chamber to accommodate farms, mines, an enchanting room, a smelting and/or anvil room, or whatever else you wish.

### 
Materials

- Lots of dirt or any other kind of non-physical block
- Few torches

Description

A pillar of blocks, occupying a 1×1 space with (optionally) a small platform at the top to improve safety. Great when you have lots of one type of non-entity block. Only use a block that is affected by gravity, e.g. sand, gravel; if you want to remove the pillar later on. Remember, do not build a short pillar. We are talking about a cloud-level pillar here. 

Location

Anywhere, but preferably a forest biome.

Construction

First, equip your block. Then, point at the ground, hold your right mouse button and jump. Repeat until you are at cloud level or any other level that skeleton arrows cannot reach you. After that, in order to minimize the risk of falling off, build a platform at the top of the pillar and light it up. It's all up to you on what you want to do with the shelter after that. For the Nomadic player, just stay up there until the sun rises. Dismantle the platform (if present) and mine the pillar blocks below you, until you reach ground level. 

REMEMBER: If you are planning on building a real shelter up there, do not build above layer 250 (as the height limit is just above you and could compromise your structure.)

### Watchtower
Materials

- About 40 blocks of your choice for the central pillar
- About 25 blocks for the rim
- Fences to add guardrails (can be ignored if you are careful)
- A ladder to get up and down the tower
- A door and a trapdoor to ease with entry
- A few torches.

Description

An expanded version of the above pillar and platform, this shelter is now a proper tower, allowing it to be shorter in height without losing protective capability.

A good shelter should not only protect you from any type of hostile mobs during the night, but also prevent a surprise Creeper ambush in the morning. This shelter type achieves this without the need for sophisticated materials such as glass or doors and can be set up pretty quickly.

The design is essentially a tower with a rim for night-time protection, but with some gaps between the tower and rim to see what is going on below in the morning, and have a slash at any assembled hostiles before leaving the shelter.

Location

This shelter is best suited for wide-open terrain or hilltops.

Construction

- Build a simple 3×3×6 solid tower.
- Once you get to the top of the tower, build out a 5×5 rim on it and add fences to the edges.
- Add torches to light up the rim.
- Dig a 1×1×6 shaft inside the center of the tower.
- Addladdersand atrapdoorto the shaft and add adoorto the entrance. Wait for dawn inside the shaft, behind locked (trap)doors.

### Open-Air
Not what you think.

Materials

- Dirt

Description

Sure, it might not stop invading spiders, (To stop invading spiders: Get some extra blocks to go around the top level of your walls. Spiders may climb, but not upside down!), but at least it works for the first night! The Open-Air is basically walls surrounding you. No roof. This can easily transition into a permanent house. Feel free to add a roof after you build the walls, but it won't be an Open-Air any more at that point.

Location

Flat, open ground. 

Construction

First, gather your dirt and basic necessities. Place your dirt in a (preferably, size is up to you) 5×5 area. Once you've built a 1-layer 'wall', build until you have a 3-layer wall. By this time, it should be sunset. Again, the time will vary, depending on the number of layers on your wall. After you have built your wall, jump down to your 'shelter'. Done! Note that spiders will be able to climb over the walls and enter your shelter, and phantoms will still fly in, but adding a rim will prevent spiders from invading your home. Enjoy your night. 
Don't fill the area! An optional way to do this is to instead dig a pit and dig out the blocks around where the wall is. This way you're gaining materials instead of using them.

Extras

- Torches
- Add a roof (doing so will turn your Open-Air into a proper house, in which you're free on expanding)
- Improved wall (stone, for example.)
- Windows (which are highly recommended to be built, only if you want to add a roof)

### Mushroom house
Materials

- A mushroom (Either kind works)
- Some bone meal

Description

Using a red huge mushroom, you can quickly make a tent to spend the night in. When you dismantle the shelter later by mining the mushroom blocks you can get more mushrooms that you can use to make more mushroom houses later, or some mushroom stew to eat.

Location

Pretty much anywhere flat. Or use a mushroom found in a swamp ‌[Bedrock Edition  only] or dark forest biome and skip planting.

Construction

For a red mushroom tent, make sure there is plenty of flat space around, dig a 1-block deep hole in the ground, plant the mushroom in it, and use bonemeal on it. Be sure to stand only one block away so you will not be suffocated when it grows. Then, put a torch on the stem, and wait until morning, then, dig yourself out. If you do not dig a hole for the mushroom, there is a chance that the mushroom may leave a 1-block high gap that spiders can fit through, or sometimes even a 2-block high gap, just fill it in with dirt.

For a brown mushroom tower, just plant the mushroom and fertilize it. No need to dig the hole. Then, pillar jump to the top with dirt or sand, or to make it spider proof, place ladders up the stem and a hatch to stop monsters.

If you grow multiple mushrooms on top of each other, you can create a tower; see below.

### Mushroom tower
- A mushroom tower waystation with cobblestone extensions

Description

For extra security and visibility, why not make your mushroom into a tower? Stacking both red and brown giant mushrooms can make a great instant landmark/safe haven while traveling (especially in forests or mountainous areas) by growing 3-5 giant mushrooms on top of each other.

Materials

- 3-5 mushrooms
- Bonemeal
- Torches
- Dirt
- Lots of ladders

Location

A space with nothing above it for 12-15 squares, or the mushroom won't grow.

Construction

When it's dark enough, plant a mushroom in a space with nothing above it, use bonemeal to enlarge, put a ladder on the stem, punch one hole at the top of the ladder. Put a square of dirt directly above the stem and repeat earlier steps two to three times. Since nearly any type of block or useful item can be placed on top of a mushroom safely, a brown mushroom can be easily used as a waystation, with torches to prevent enemy spawning and to aid in visibility, beds to sleep in, as well as chests and crafting table/furnaces. The extremely fast process can be used to escape enemies at sundown. Red mushrooms are best used as a visible landmark, but can be expanded using dirt or cobblestone to use as a waystation as well. 

Pros and cons

- Pro: If you like having tall structures or skyscrapers this can be used for it to be more resource friendly.
- Pro: If you use brown mushrooms, it will always be in a flat circle.
- Pro: You can easily top your tower off with a sphere if you use a red mushroom on top.
- Pro: Safe from skeleton archers. (Watch out for creepers hanging around the base of the mushroom.)
- Con: Quite fragile (mushroom blocks have low blast resistance and hardness)
- Con: Requiresbone mealand mushrooms which can be a bit hard to obtain.
- Con: Not enderman proof as they can teleport up to your shelter and may "steal" your walls/floor. (add a roof above the top mushroom to prevent the first problem)

Extras

- Bed
- Crafting Table
- Chest
- Furnace, especially if built by a mine as a landmark/waystation
- Torches
- Trapdoor
- More mushrooms

### Tree Home
No, not a tree house. A proper tree home.

Materials

- A tree
	- or a sapling and bonemeal (for larger trees, use 4 saplings in a 2×2 grid)
- Building blocks for the walls, like wooden planks
- Torches for lighting

Description

Very similar to a mushroom shelter, only using an oak or birch tree instead. Find any regular tree (or grow one by planting a sapling and using bonemeal on it, for larger trees, use 4 saplings in a 2×2 grid), and surround the area around the tree so that the leaves become a roof. Then, mine the log in the center to make space and gain some wood, but leave at LEAST 1 log in the tree to keep the leaves alive. This also has the advantage of telling you the time of day on the "Fancy" graphics option and getting you some wood for the first day. Here's how:

Before



















































After
































































Location

Preferably a forest biome.

### Emergency Treehouse
Materials

- About 5 dirt or sand.

Description

Find a tree (the bigger the better, but more costly) and pillar jump up on it. This is a great nomadic shelter, as it takes seconds to build and has a nice view of the outdoors and you can shoot monsters down from it. The biggest drawback is the inability to mine, so a cliff-side cave or cave shelter may be preferable.

Location

A jungle biome, in a tree. Jungle trees can grow to be the tallest trees in the game. Craft some ladders and make your way to the top.

### Compact
Materials

- A handful to About a stack and a half (80-96) of planks (or dirt, but planks are better).

Description

Stand where you are right now, and make sure the 5×5 space around you isn't occupied. Right after you check, imagine you are an enchantment table, and place the dirt blocks/planks as if they were bookshelves. Repeat this until you have some walls that are 4 blocks high and you used up exactly 60 blocks of material. With your remaining material, build the ceiling. This method gives you a 3×3×3 space- that means you have plenty of space to do a lot, and not big enough for ghasts to spawn in the Nether.

Location

Anywhere, but not suitable for rough biomes, such as badlands (mesa) and extreme hills. Preferably plains or a desert.

## Easy
### Micro Mansion
Materials

- ~40wood planks
- Somewooden slabs
- Bed
- Double Chest
- Glowstone or Torches
- 2wooden stairs
- Glass
- Wooden doororiron door
- Furnace
- Crafting Table

Description

A blast furnace will come useful, same with a smoker.

### Treehouse
Materials

- ~80wood planks


Description

Treehouses provide a high base. They are useful, especially against creepers, because most are too high for creeper explosions to reach. They are often used with a bow and arrows because they are excellent sniping spots. Another advantage of treehouses is that they are a great lookout point. They give you a good view of the map, helping you find the place for your next shelter. Also, if you are thinking of making a treehouse as your permanent home, you could expand it by linking it to other trees, giving the player an extremely large and good lookout view. 


Location

The best tree for this is the jungle tree. This method of shelter does not only help you stay away from mobs at night- It's a great look-out position, especially if the jungle borders a desert or a plains biome. You can even create bridge gaps from other trees to make a whole network of treehouses! An added bonus also comes with the location- an almost endless supply of wood!


Construction

The first thing you will build when constructing a treehouse is the staircase. Without a staircase, you cannot reach the treehouse. The amount of stairs you build will vary depending on the height of the tree you are building in. Make these stairs and place them. Remember to place wooden planks under the stairs to support them. (Not only does this make them easier to build, it also makes the staircase look better.)

- Vines act like ladders (without a hitbox).

Now, you should have a staircase that leads to the top of the tree. Climb this staircase and lay down a 4×5 base of wooden planks. One common practice is to remove a layer of leaves and then, build the base. This maintains the same level as you would have had without a base. 

Next, build a layer of outer walls. These should only cover the border. To be economical, you could skip the corners, as they are not necessary. Build two more layers on each of these. 

Now, you will construct a roof. You don't need to add another border level; this was compensated for in the last step. Instead, fill in the top border with wooden planks. This roof should block out most of the light; look in the "Extras" section for ways to counter this.


Alternate No-Stairs Method

A more effective and easy method to construct a pathway for access to the treehouse would be to use ladders placed on the trunk of the tree to reach the entrance of the treehouse instead of stairs to access the treehouse which makes it less likely for mobs to climb onto the treehouse and also the benefit of using this method is that it uses fewer materials. It is strongly recommended that you use a trapdoor at the top of the ladders to prevent mobs from gaining access to the treehouse via the ladders.

Alternate roofless method

This method is best in high trees. Simply the same as before, but only build walls one high and then, place fences on top. It is useful when fighting mobs like creepers.

If you connect with other trees in a jungle you can make a large circular disk platform around each, allowing large, roofless, and safe "rooms". This method is only safe when you have plenty of torches.

Extras

- Staircase to the top
- Window
- Treehouse link: Multiple treehouses linked together. Best if treehouse is built in a forest.

- A good place to build a treehouse.
- What your finished staircase should look like.
- A finished treehouse.
- The interior of a treehouse.

### ICE CASTLE
An ice castle is some icebergs contained by a wall of blue ice, and corridors in the iceberg lit by lanterns. You can have villages inside of it if you want. Bedrooms are useful to make it good for living in, and you can also make towers. If you want to make a successful ice castle you will need blue ice, lanterns, beds and doors. You can make a courtyard out of stone. If you are in Creative mode you can make impenetrable walls with bedrock.

### Igloo
An example of an igloo.
Materials

- A lot ofsnow. (If you have a pumpkin, you could make a snow farm!)
- Ashovel.
- Optionally, someIcefor the windows.


Description

Not the strongest tower, but can be done if you live in a snowy biome.

Location

Any snow biome

Construction

First, get some snow, you'll need a lot of it. Use a shovel to get snowballs by breaking the snow. After you have collected enough, place them in a 2×2 square in the crafting grid. Get the snow blocks and build your shelter with them.

During construction, it might start snowing. Note that snow can fall on snows, causing a snow layer to form on top.

These snow shelters often look great in snow biomes.

Igloos can also generate naturally. These naturally generating igloos make great shelters, as they always generate with a door and helpful furniture such as a bed, crafting table and furnace, and sometimes even a brewing stand and a chest containing useful items.

Extras

- Windows made ofice.Packed iceandblue ice, however are not translucent.
- A well of liquid water.
- A fireplace. (Snowblocksandpacked ice/blue icedo not melt, but ice and snow layers do)
- A wooden door. (Use birch to keep it looking like an igloo)
- A snow farm!

### Portable House
Materials

- Wood, Cobble or Stone; any basic material except dirt. Preferably Cobble.
- Ladders
- Wooden/Iron Door
- Trapdoor

Description

Don't want to spend 5 minutes in a hole? Build this mobile fortress that takes 5 minutes to build and 5 minutes to destroy!

Location

A 6×6 or 9×9 flat space

Construction

First, build a 1×1 tower 6 blocks up on all the corners. Next, connect each corner together. Now, build the wall and dig a 1×2 hole for the door do not use windows. Now, fill in the roof, but leave a 2×2 space at a wall for the trapdoors and ladders. Place the ladders under the hole and then, on the roof of the house make some battlements. Now, place the trapdoor and you're done! You now have a mobile fortress that's safe from creepers and if a spider gets in, you can run down the hatch!

Extras

- Mine
- Utilities
- Extra story
- Defense Turrets
- Trapdoor traps

### Camouflage House
Materials

- A stack or two of dirt
- Wooden planks or stone for the inside wall (optional)

Description

A house made out of dirt that blends in with the environment. There are two main versions of this, a house of leaves in a jungle atop a tree, or a base on top of a hill that looks just like the rest of the landscape.

Location

A forest, plains, or jungle biome.

Construction

Use the dirt to blend in with the environment. Make sure to adjust to elevations. The grass will grow on your roof, so it looks even cooler. For maximum security, conceal your door behind a 1×1×2 stack of dirt and don't add any windows. If you're really ambitious, make a piston door with dirt and sticky pistons. Hide the lever behind a block of dirt. This is perfect in multiplayer as it hides your shelter from griefers and thieves.

Extras

- Bed, torches, crafting table
- Underground shelter underneath the dirt.
- Tunnel to other camo shelters!
- Piston door made out of dirt and sticky pistons.
- Hidden chest full of valuables.
- Flowers, tallgrass and trees for a hint of realism.
- Stone brickinside, protects against griefers with x-ray mods.

### House
The expansion to the Open-Air, in detail.

Materials

- See Open-Air, in the Nomadic section, for walls, but made of something preferably stronger like cobblestone. For the roof, any non-entity (if made out of glass, will be better than windows for lighting).
- Torches
- Sand (for windows)

Description

You've played the game with the walls, now, play it with the roof! A basic house.

Location

Flat, open ground.

Construction

First, build a wall, just like the nomadic open-air. After that, close the roof, add windows (smelt the sand with your furnace), and you're set for expansion! If you like, dig your floor and replace it with any block you like.

Extras

- Mine
- Upper Levels
- Lower Levels
- Traps
- A door
- Corners made out of wood
- Roof made out of stairs
- Chimney
- Carpet

### Cave Home
Materials

- Fair amount of construction-type blocks (cobblestone,wood planks, anddirtall work fine).
- Ample supply oftorches.

Description

A house constructed using a surface cave as its base structure. It can be dangerous due to its initially dark state, but allows for easy expansion. Being a cave, it will contain a mine already within itself.

Location

This type of house can be built in any surface cave one finds. It is a bonus if you find one with coal already in it, as you have your supply of torches supplied by your house. A cave with multiple surface entrances can be used, but may prove more difficult to secure.

Construction

Once you have found a suitable cave, the first step is to seal off the entrances. Use any building material to create a complete seal to keep out night monsters. A wooden door may be added if you have enough wood and time. Otherwise, just seal the entrance off completely (make sure to use torches first, or you may find yourself in the dark) leaving no gaps.

If you proceed deeper into your cave, and monsters are found, it would be wise to seal off the rear end of your cave as well. That is unless you are able to deal with the monsters.

After this, you can hollow out the cave to your liking.

Extras

- Explore the entirety of your house/cave, and extract the riches hiding in your basement.
- Add more rooms by hollowing out more of the cave. All you need is a pickaxe!

### Outpost
Materials

- Fences (for legs)
- Woodorcobblestoneas a building material
- Glassblocks or panes (optional)
- A couple of slabs of the same material as the building material
- Laddersand atrapdoor

Description

A nice house to build. Looks nice when built-in water and lava, if possible. Can also be used as guardhouses/lookout posts. You can also choose to take over a pillager outpost, and make it homely!

Location

In a lake (of water OR lava) or simply on the land (high ground is recommended, using as lookout).

Construction

Once you have found a suitable place to build, start building the fences up from the bottom of the lake on the corners of a 7×7 square, 3 blocks or higher above the ground. Now, start building the actual structure on the 'legs'. This should create a 5×5 interior. Then, Dig a hole in the floor wherever you like and extend a pillar of blocks downward. On those, place ladders and place a trapdoor at the top. Then, do whatever you want with the inside. Don't forget to add some light!

Extras

- Expand to a bigger square
- Add another floor
- Start a farm underneath

### Water House
materials

- Door
- Pickaxe
- Torch

Description

A house underwater, where no hostile mobs can get to it. Except for possibly ocean guardians, if you are near an ocean monument… (make sure to not make it so deep that you drown on your way back up!)

Location

In an ocean, river, or deepish lake, preferably not near an ocean monument.

Construction

Go in the water and go about 5 blocks down. Then, mine into the side of the body of water and make a room (you can expand on it later) then, place a door down at the entrance, making an airlock. Then, place a torch down inside. expand on it any way you want to.

Extras

You can use signs in place of the door.
You could use glowstone, sea lanterns, or some other light-emitting block in place of the torches in case your house floods.

## Medium
### Village Bunker
 Description 
Very safe and well suited for PvP servers or a friend's vanilla.
Easy to make and fast to make bigger this shelter basically consists of an underground base made below a village with the entrance under a villager's house.

Construction
Find a villager house and remove one block from the floor, then continue mining below you while placing ladders. When you reached the height you want to build the house start mining around (preferably in a square).
When you finished mining cover the walls with planks and you've made your house.

Extra
Try adding furnaces and chests, if you're planning to stay long then build up a farm and start strip mining.

### Desert Shelter
A 5x5 "Day 1" desert house made mostly of sand, with part-sandstone roof, in a Superflat Preset Desert.
Maybe you ended up there because you got lost, or maybe you wanted to explore. Whatever the reason, you are trapped in a desert and you are in need of shelter for when night falls.

### Day 1 Desert Shelter layout
Base square[edit | edit source]
First lay out an 11×11 square by digging a 13×13 trench, 2 blocks deep. Dig the square one deep, then go back and dig it 2 deep. 
Start by putting down a marker, then dig one block at the marker, then dig 6 blocks in each direction from the marker. That's the first edge of your square. From the ends of that first trench dig up 12 blocks from each end. Check the lengths are both 13, then join the last side of the trench. 

Base 13x13 trench for the 11x11 desert shelter plot.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Digging on a flat section of desert you will collect 93-94 sand digging these trenches. To complete this design you need another 22-23 sand. Getting 128 in total is not a bad number. You should also collect 12 cacti, or an absolute minimum of 4. If dirt is available, collect 16 dirt, or an absolute minimum of 12. If dirt is available you need 64 less sand, so don't worry about sand, you will have plenty just from digging the trenches.

### Lower walls and pits
Now in the center of your 11×11 square, build a 5×5 house. Start the doorway opposite your marker, 3 clear blocks distant. If you are in a hurry skip the corners (as shown). Build the walls 2 high, out of sand. The pits are one deep. They are to stop zombie children coming through your open 'windows' and 'doors'. 

The first level of the house (1 block high) is as below. Leave an open space for the two doorways. Dig small single-block pits beneath where the window openings will go. Dig semi-circular (5-block) pits around the blocks of sand that will form the lower half of the two 'doors'.

### Upper walls
The second level of the house (2 high) is as below. Place cacti on the top half of the two 'doors' (maybe later when you are closing up for the night). Leave a one-block open space for the upper part of each of the doorways and for each of the 'window' openings.

### Roof and lintels
The third level of the house (3 blocks high) is as below. Use dirt or sandstone for these blocks above the doorways, window openings, and forming the roof, as they need to ignore gravity whenever there is air beneath them. 

If you did not find dirt, craft some sandstone right away. You can easily create 16 sandstone from the sand you dug out of the trenches. You need a minimum of 12, but 16 is an efficient number (craft 64 sand) and allows some spare in case you make a mistake. Running out of sandstone can get you killed on your first night!

### Roof defenses
If you have enough time and materials, complete the 4 corners as 4-high sand pillars (sticking up one block above roof level) and put cacti on the corners.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

If you don't have time or materials to do the corners, don't worry about it, do it the next day. If you have even more time and materials, add a second set of 4 cacti, each raised on one block of sand to match the others. This is so they are safe for you to bump into, but not safe for spiders to climb over.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

You now have a spider-resistant roof that will grow into a semi-lethal spider trap in a day or so.

### Interior finish
It's probably dark by now, so get inside, but you can make some finishing touches on the inside of the house for added safety. Dig down one block in each of the interior corners. This gives you stress-free space to hide if mobs get close, or from ranged attacks. Leave the blocks by the windows and doors in place so you are able to look out. Leave the one sand block in the center of the house in place so you can pillar-jump up through your skylight to take a quick, careful look around.

Keep a few blocks of sand handy in your inventory for pillar jumping. And in case you get really freaked out and just want to rest, you can block up the 'window' openings.

### Day 2 and 3
If you develop your shelter by adding an outer ditch (spaced 3 blocks further out), and add denser layers of cacti, and finally a pillar to help you navigate home, it will look something like this:

- Day 2, with second trench and a low-density cactus wall.
- Day 3, with a navigation pillar and a few more cacti.
- Dusk of Day 3, with a denser wall of cacti.

### Cobblestone spruce
Materials

1 spruce sapling, bonemeal, 1 lava bucket, 1 water bucket, 1 door, 1 fireproof block.

Description
You don't use many items to build this shelter, and this shelter is fireproof.

Location
Anywhere where is a small amount of trees nearby and the surface under leaves of the spruce tree is on one layer.

Construction
Place spruce sapling (Optional: Use bonemeal to grow it faster). Place block on top of the spruce tree. Next, place lava on top of that block. Wait for lava to go to surface (you can wait longer than that, as well). Place water on block that you placed in point two. Wait to water change all lava to cobblestone. Take water. Mine 2×1 hole on the wall. Place door in it. Ta-da! shelter finished using 5 items.

### Freestanding
Materials

64-256 wood planks, cobblestone, stone

Description

These freestanding shelters are not usually the first shelter that the player builds, because it usually consumes the time fast. These shelters provide good protection against mobs.

Location

You can build these type of shelters anywhere where there is flat ground. You can also clear out a flat area, but this will consume more time and leave you vulnerable in the night if you don't have your house built in time.

Construction

The size of the shelter is decided by you, the player. The foundation can be any size you want, but a bigger building will take more time to complete and, hey, the sun doesn't stay in the sky forever! First, make the foundation of the building as wide as you want. Then, you can make a wooden floor, or you can just keep the ground as your floor. Jump and place a block underneath you to make the shelter taller. When your shelter is complete, you can make access to the rooftop, if you like. Placing a door or fence gate at the entrance is important because without one, the aggressive mobs can come inside your house and kill you. Also, make sure your shelter is well lit to avoid mobs spawning inside; the bigger your house is, however, the more torches you need. A lantern provide slightly more illumination than a torch.

An example of a player's base that contains a watchtower.
Extras

- Watchtower (used for sniping and looking for resources)
- Windows
- Greenhouse (SeeFarming)
- Skylight (extra light and mobs can't spawn on it. Also looks really cool!)

### 
Materials

Basically the same as freestanding and many obsidian

Description

Same as freestanding, but more protective and can be used as a decoy for griefers. This still retains the classic beauty of freestanding shelter. If you want to make this as your permanent shelter, consider adding some defense around the house.

Pros

- Still retains the classic beauty of freestanding shelter.
- More protection.
- Can be used to teach a lesson togriefers.

Cons

- Bulkier than normal freestanding shelter.
- Difficult to get theobsidian.

Location

An open field or places that can easily attract griefers (for griefers decoy)

Construction

For the basics, it's the same as the freestanding. For additional protection, place the obsidian as the base wall. Then, cover the outer part with wooden planks or dirt (for attracting griefers to burn it or exploding it). For the inner part, you can either use planks or any other blocks. Don't forget to cover the exposed obsidian as it could alert griefers of your trap or reduce the beauty of your house.

Extras

- Furniture.
- An anti-griefingtrap.
- Secret storage room or safe-room (must NOT be inside or near the house).
- Redstone trap to teach griefers a lesson.

### Two-Story House
Materials

About 6 stacks of wood, 28 cobblestone and plenty of torches. 

Description

A basic two-story house that has a deck. It provides protection, and the bed is on the second floor.

Location

A flat area.

Construction

Make a 6×6 foundation and fill it with wooden planks. Then, make a simple frame for the first floor with wooden planks and cobblestone on the edges of the walls. Add 2×2 holes in the center of each wall for the windows, but leave the front open with a 2×2 hole for the 2 doors. Do the same thing that you did for the first floor, but put a single door on the left side of the front of the house on the second floor. Then, add a 6×3 deck off of the front of the second floor. Add a railing and supports to the deck using fence blocks. Now, make a staircase to the second floor to the right of the door if you're looking at the doors from the inside. Adding torches is obviously recommended. If you want a bigger house, it is highly recommended to build a 7×7. Just follow the steps giving to you earlier.

Extras

- A basement.
- A fireplace inside with iron bars around it.
- Redstone lamps

### Hollowed-Out Mountain
Materials

- Pickaxes
- Shovel (for any dirt/gravel you come across)
- At least 16 torches

Description

The title says it all: a mountain, preferably not too big, hollowed out and converted into a shelter! Good protection, as watchtowers and a moat can easily be added after making a basic shelter within the mountain.

Location

A small, freestanding mountain, not part of a large mountain range, preferably 25-40 blocks tall. A good advantage is that as you build, you are gaining material, and not losing. Time: 1–2 days.

Construction

Find a mountain that matches the description above. Bring along a pickaxe or two, depending on its size. Hollow out the entire mountain, add a staircase/ladders and some floors, and you are ready to begin customizing!

Extras

- Wooden bridge connection to other nearby mountains
- Greenhouse
- Trapdoor drawbridge
- Armory
- Watchtowers
- A castle on top to get rid of all the cobblestone from hollowing out the inside of the mountain

### Floating
Materials

- Plenty (at least 200) of cobble, planks, or other general building material
- At minimum, 1 door
- Other material needed for house additions

Description

A house that floats in mid-air! Protects greatly, as mobs can't get in and spiders have nothing to climb on. However, it can take a bit longer to start building than freestanding structures, about 1–3 days.

Location

A cliff face, preferably over water, is the best place to build the structure. Any large hill is a good starting point (this option is assumed for the construction section). With more work, however, it can be built anywhere, using a staircase or water elevator for access.

Construction

1. Choose an elevation. The recommended height is over 10 blocks.
2. Build a 1-block wide bridge out about 5 blocks from the hill, beginning the count from the furthest horizontal point on the hill within 3 blocks in any direction.
3. If you want a house below the level of your bridge (a basement, perhaps), make a pillar from the ground up to the desired lowest elevation. Build around it to the desired foundation size. Remove the pillar when the construction of the foundation is completed.
4. From this base, build, as usual, making sure to place a door at the level of the bridge, with an empty space above it so you can jump to and from the door. Don't forget you are still vulnerable to roof spawning if precautions aren't taken!
5. Make a one or two block gap between the bridge and the door. This is the system that so secures the structure. Mobs coming to you will simply fall below if they attempt to reach you when the door is closed. It is unlikely that they would jump the pit, but it is still a possibility. If you want mobs to fall into a pit, place a sign on the block you would jump from to your door on the side facing towards the door and they will think it is another block and walk onto it.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

- Continue building. One great thing about this type of shelter is that you aren't nearly as hemmed in by hills or other terrains! Generally, you can build in any direction for a great distance. The only concern is that you must build the new foundations, and therefore must use a few more materials.

Notes

You may have some trouble getting into your house. One thing to make sure of is the door. Since the hinge area is solid even when open, you should jump to the door from the side opposite the hinge. Simply widen the bridge at the end to do so more easily. The area under the pit should ideally have some sort of fall-breaker in case misjudgment of the jump occurs. Once you are confident you can jump it consistently, you can build a mob trap for anything that approaches. Make sure that you can escape it if you DO fall, however.

Extras:

These will be the same as a normal house- except anything to do with the underground. Just build that sort of structure on the area opposite the bridge/stairs. Even grass can be brought up with a stair of dirt. Do not use a full stair with lower support, as to prevent intrusion while you wait for the spread. You can also add nether portals for easy transport up and down. If you do, make sure to block it off or hide it so griefers and ghasts can't get to it.

Also, when playing multiplayer, cover the outside of the floor with white wool or possibly quartz. People that will look up at it will think that's it's a cloud! And you don't have to worry about griefers! Another way to conceal a sky base is to make it out of chests and trapped chests and place blocks temporarily because chestlike blocks don't render far away from players

### Bunker
Materials

- 6-8 stacks ofcobblestoneorstone, depending on size
- Torches
- Iron doors
- Glass

Description

This is a relatively simple shelter to build, although requires a fair amount of gathering and smelting to obtain all the required materials.

Location

It can be built on any wide open flat space.

Construction

The bunker is a single-story shelter made entirely of stone, with the walls always being at least two blocks thick. Size is down to the player's preference, although a 12×12 outer wall perimeter will provide ample space inside for a bed, workbench and multiple chests and furnaces. Ideally, an iron door should be placed on at least two sides of the building, in case a creeper remains to lurk outside one door in the morning. Stone buttons or levers can be used to control the doors both inside and out. With the walls being at least two blocks thick, the player can safely sleep in a bed at night without having to worry about being awoken by hostile mobs. Windows should be added on all sides so the player can be certain that the outside of the shelter is clear before venturing out in the morning.

### Underground Bunker
Description

A place to hide out and undetectable from above ground mobs and players. Perfect if you need cobble and you gain materials not lose them.

Construction

Dig down 12-16 blocks dig out a room. Make an iron door at the entrance or you could build a house above that and make a piston entrance. Anyway, you're free to expand and decorate.

### 
Materials

- 8-10 stacks ofstone brickorstone slab, depending on location (far or close to a stronghold)
- Torches
- Iron doors
- Glass

Description

This is a harder shelter to build, mainly because it requires lots of stone or exploring.

Location

It can be built on any wide open flat space.

Construction

The bunker#2 is a single-story shelter made entirely of stone, with the walls always being at least three blocks thick. Size is down to the player's preference, although a 12×12 outer wall perimeter will provide ample space inside for a bed, workbench and multiple chests and furnaces. Ideally, an iron door should be placed on at least two sides of the building, in case a creeper remains to lurk outside one door in the morning. Stone buttons or levers can be used to control the doors both inside and out. With the walls being at least two blocks thick, the player can safely sleep in a bed at night without having to worry about being awoken by hostile mobs. Windows should be added on all sides so the player can be certain that the outside of the shelter is clear before venturing out in the morning. This is especially effective against armies of players, as iron doors and stone bricks are much harder to break, plus, there's the added benefit of having silverfish coming out and attacking the attackers every now and again.

A good idea would be to put guards on a bunch of these outside your PvP base, with TNT in the tunnels if someone breaks through.

### Underground Base
Description
It's a good idea to make you one of these when you spawn because it can protect you from mobs, but you might have to make two stone pickaxes and shovels.

Location
Underground or in cliffs that are not hollow.

Construction

Find a cliff that meets the above specifications. Dig a 1×2 tunnel 4 blocks deep. Then, make a 7×7 3-block high space here. Put up the door and some torches, and voila! Your cave is pretty much complete. Put all of your basic Minecraft home items on the floor next to the walls. You may also want to replace the ugly dirt and stone in the walls and ceiling with some more aesthetic blocks, like wood or (for a more dungeon-like feel) stone bricks.

Notes

Your cave's main weakness is that has only one exit. You may want to dig a 1×2 "emergency exit" out of your base, so that you can sneak out if there are creepers patrolling your main one. It's also preferable to mark the base so that it can be seen from far away.

Extras

- A "balcony" protruding from higher up the side of the cliff, which you can use to snipe mobs.
- Rooms, rooms, rooms. Make branches coming out of your main room leading to smaller (or bigger) rooms, like a bedroom, smelting room, storage room, etc.

### Circular Village
This kind of shelter/village is good on a multiplayer PvP server as it can be defended with a minimum of 3 people with little hassle if you can't defend it, then, you wouldn't be able to defend anything else short of a castle.

The one big drawback of this kind of dwelling is that it is highly visible, although it would be possible to create this in an underground cavern.

Materials

- Lots of cobblestone/or some kind of reasonably hard to break block, if possible use obsidian.

In singleplayer, it is possible to make this out of wood for aesthetic purposes.

Description

- A circular radiating dwelling designed for defensibility combined with eye-pleasing open areas

Location

- Anywhere flat, including large manmade caves and the Nether

Construction

- On your first night, build a small house.

This is the center of your village, around it you will construct your other buildings

- Next up, you need to create 3 buildings around your center one, this may take quite some time.

There should be 2 L shaped ones and one straight one so that there are three entrances leading to your central building, like so:



|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

- There should be no doors facing outwards so that the only ways into or out of the village are through the gaps in the buildings, or through the buildings themselves.
- The gaps are easier to defend if they are only one block wide. Now, all you have to do on a PvP faction server is to recruit 2 more people, and when you get attacked, stick one person at each gap.
- As your faction grows you may wish to build a further group of encircling buildings, but remember to only ever have as many gaps as you have people and, when the outer circle falls, fall back to the middle.

Notes

- Always remember that those gaps aren't impervious, and you're sure going to receive company with that size of the village.
- An obvious thing to do with this design would be to cut out 2 gaps and just make a C (or O with adooror hole) shaped building all around the outside, you can do this to obvious defensive benefit, feel free.

Extras

- A panic room (never put this in the center, put it where they'll least expect it).
- Farms (there are two good places to put farms, the first is around the outer edge of your village, in the same style as the buildings, this adds to beauty, and the second is to place them in the gaps between the central house and the others meaning you're less likely to have them griefed or stolen, as players have to get past your cordon first).
- Bonfire!On singleplayer, you can redesign your central building into an eating area with a bonfire and ovens, but this is purely aesthetic and will have no use in multiplayer whatsoever, and make sure you don't put any flammable block near the fire.
- 

### Fort
A fort
A walled base capable of housing multiple players. It is built mostly for defensive values. It basically consists of a wall with buildings attached to it.

Materials

128 to 1000 material of your choice.

Description

A square of the wall with buildings attached to the inside of it. Towers can be put on the corners. Some designs have an open yard near the entrance with no buildings nearby. 

Construction

First, build a square or rectangle base with blocks. Then, build walls around the edge, leaving room for an exit/entrance. The next step is to plan the shape and build internal buildings, like towers, a bedroom, storeroom, etc. Give easy access to the walls, which should probably be three blocks high, so falling from them won't cause damage.

If you make your wall spider proof, make sure that you have a lip every second brick to prevent mobs from sneaking up on you as you leave. Not leaving gaps does have the advantage of making skeletons walk under it, rendering them unable to shoot you from the towers (though they will probably ambush you later).

Extras

- Escape tunnels just in case that zombie siege happens
- A mine
- Farms (doesn't have to be inside the fortress)
- Snow golem turrets (keep in mind that this won't hurt mobs)
- Dispenser turrets (put a dispenser in walls with arrows and put a pressure plate hooked up to it)

### 
A nice looking house that stops all mobs and is somewhat easy to build.

Materials

- 128 blocks of cobblestone
- 64 Glass or glass panes
- 32 wood

Construction

Make an outline of your building that is one block high out of cobble. Then, make studs with the cobble and the glass/glass panes like this: cobblestone, glass, cobblestone. Then, top it off with another layer of cobble. Once that is done, use the wood to make a roof and you are set. You can use the roof however you like, but make sure to prevent spiders from entering.

Notes

- This design is visually attractive and repels any mobs.
- To add more layers, simply repeat the process.

### Villager House
A standard home having many different types.

Materials

- Cobblestone
- Wooden planks
- Logs
- Wooden pressure plates
- Wooden stairs
- Cobblestone stairs
- Stone slabs
- Lava
- Iron bars
- Glass panes
- Bookshelves

Description

These homes depend on what you plan to build. How long they take to build will depend on what you plan to build. These are aesthetically pleasing homes, and don't require too many materials to construct them, depending on what you want of course.

Construction

See village blueprints for construction details.

Notes

- These are intricate, but can be completed within one day provided you have the required materials.
- If you are in a desert or other area and cannot acquire the regular materials, you can use materials in place of those; e.g. use spruce logs and planks instead of oak logs and planks or etc.

### Tower House
Description

This is a tower that has several floors and isn't that hard to build, but takes a while to make and requires a good deal of materials.

Materials

- Several stacks of wood
- A good deal of cobblestone to improve the house's integrity
- Lots of ladders/stairs

Construction

Build a one-block layer of cobblestone or other good flooring material. Make it as big as you want, but smaller is better because it means you won't have to make each floor as big. Next, make four three-high pillars of cobblestone on the corners. Make more pillars if you are paranoid of creepers, but the cobblestone should help absorb the blast in case of creeper attack. Fill in the walls with your wood. If you really don't want any creepers or have too much cobblestone, use that instead. Fill in the top with wood for a ceiling—two blocks high is nice, use slabs if you really want efficiency. Add windows. Use glass panes or iron bars. Repeat this until you reach your desired height.

Notes

Sneak while you build this! Falling is fatal from the 7th floor or above. The original author died while building the seventh floor.

Jungle trees are quite helpful. You can get nine or ten floors from two trees.

Make a quarry near this, especially if you are using several cobblestone pillars/cobblestone walls. Make it in the basement if you have a small area to build.

Try to keep the size down. 8×8 is a nice size.

Add-ons

- A quarry in the basement
- Sniper towers/deck
- A farm (make nearby or in basement, luring pigs up three floors is hard!)
- A wall or moat for the really paranoid people
- Wall-mounted cannons

### Treehouse 2.0
Description

Like the treehouse, but better for surviving in.

Materials

- Several stacks of wood planks
- One or more axes
- Torches
- 1–2 hours
- Trapdoors

Construction

First, find a tree. A jungle tree works fine, but it looks better if made in a large oak tree. Then, use wood planks to make a staircase winding around the outside of the tree, so you can jump up blocks all the way up. When you are 4 blocks beneath the top, hollow out an area. If you are doing it on a jungle tree, this step is not necessary. Then, build out as much as you want, replacing the walls, floor, and roof with wood planks. Keep the space open for you to come up the staircase. Keep windows open, and add trapdoors where you enter from the staircase. Add a workbench, furnaces, torches, and a bed to complete your new home.

Notes

This can be expanded upon. Simply build bridges to other trees and repeat this process. This is a good structure for avoiding monsters, but the trapdoors are necessary to keep mobs out.

Add - Ons

- More rooms
- A greenhouse
- Rope bridges

### Cottage
Description

A medium-sized cottage.

Materials

- 238 oak wood planks 3¾ stacks)
- 5 chests
- 30 glass
- 1 bed (any color)
- 4 iron blocks
- 1 crafting table
- 156 stone bricks (2 and a half stacks)
- 2 doors
- 1 glowstone
- 1 chiseled stone bricks
- 2 double stone slab
- 1 fence

## Hard
These homes are complex and some may combine other shelters with large add-ons, making them different shelters like the ones below. 

### Obsidian square
the obsidian square is a large rectangle or square that is up in the sky. The walls, ceiling and floor are 1 block thick and made of obsidian. You can do everything inside of this building. You can make a courtyard or a tower or even a forest depending on your size.

### Materials
- Obsidian
- Beds
- Wooden Planks
- Carpet
- Water Bucket and soul sand (for an elevator)

### Underground Shelter
Description

These shelters are built entirely underground, usually at a depth of 15-25 blocks under the surface.

Tools

- One or more pickaxes (preferably stone) and some shovels.

Advantages of Underground Homes

Building an underground Home has several advantages, especially on multiplayer.

- Underground homes with no visible entrances are hard to find on multiplayer, without knowing the exact coordinates of the place to remove the stone or dirt blocking the entrance to your home. This is useful for preventing players from stealing your items on multiplayer servers.
- Underground bases do not require much building materials or tools—just a pickaxe and a shovel.
- While building an underground base, you are likely to come across iron and coal ores, caves, and maybe even dungeons.
- Underground base owners don't often have to worry aboutcreepersorendermenon the surface.
- Building a mine from an underground home doesn't take nearly as much digging as it would if you were building one from the surface; you may not even need a mine, as you collect minerals while digging out the rooms of a base.
- Simple underground bases are easy to build, and making them more complex isn't hard at all. You'll never have to move because of your home being too small or simple.
- While building an underground base, you don't have to worry about monsters pouring in through openings in your unfinished base, unless you are right over a cavern.
- Underground farming is easier. No animals will come, no fences are needed.
- Since there are no animals spawning in caves, making a minecart rollercoaster is much easier than on land (because the animals may get stuck in the minecart or they might get in the way unless you have it in the air.)
- Due to the time and effort of mining, you will undoubtedly get a large mountain of cobblestone as you dig, potentially being able to turn it into other structures on the surface.
- You could decide to section off part of acavernwhich would considerably reduce mining time!
- When it becomes night time, you can mine and the monsters won't affect you.

Disadvantages of Underground Homes

- When building a mine from an underground base, you will be constantly attacked by aggressive mobs, unless you're frequently placing torches or are on Peaceful mode.
- Accidentally hitting a lava lake while building an underground base can wreak havoc upon you. This would not be a problem in a freestanding home.
- Many griefers target underground homes, especially as they are padded with weak materials. This will leave you susceptible to primed TNT explosions when you enter or exit your house.
- Building an underground home is harder work than a freestanding home, as the player must remove blocks stopping its path to make more rooms.
- You must go above ground to find loot from passive mobs (unless you decide to add amob farmto your home).
- Depending on how complex the house is, it's entirely possible to get lost and need the assistance of an emergency exit.
- Some people have hacked clients, they could turn on X-Ray and find your house, however, this is less likely than somebody raiding a surface home.

Necessary Materials

- Torches
- Ladders

Location

The entrances to this shelter can be anywhere, but in multiplayer, care should be taken to avoid making your location obvious to griefers or thieves. The top of a mountain, the middle of a desert, or even inside another, well-defended shelter are great locations to place the entrance.

Construction

Dig a 2×1 tunnel downwards, placing ladders on the walls every block, and torches in small alcoves to the side. Once a suitable depth has been reached (20 blocks are recommended, but anything below 10 is acceptable. If you dig below level 16, the shelter will work as your mine.), hollow out a chamber. The size of this room is a matter of preference, but a 5×5×2 space is ideal. Light this area with torches, and your rudimentary shelter is complete. Add-ons can be expansions to the original chamber or separate "rooms" of their own. Separate some of the rooms with doors so if a monster does get in, you can hide in another room where you can figure out how to deal with the mobs.

This type of shelter can also be easily converted from the player's first shelter, provided it was built in the ground or in the side of a hill or mountain. The player can expand on this shelter, adding extra rooms and increasing the size of the rooms. Extra rooms can include a main hall, kitchen, bedroom and mine.

Extras

- An escape tunnel: absolutely necessary, as mobs inside your house will spell doom otherwise.
- Connection to mine
- At the base of the ladder, make a pool of water 2 deep so you can just jump down without harm instead of having to go down the ladder.
- Subway/railway station
- Farms (Make sure to have plenty of torches)
- Glass, ice or leaves as roofing to allow sunlight and know the time of day without a clock. Also, it lets you know if mobs await you.

### Island Stronghold
Description

A large wall and ceiling over an island for lots of protection against mobs, similar to an Irish crannog.

Necessary Materials

About 100-2000 blocks of any building materials depending on the size of your island.

Location

On a small-medium island.

Construction

Find a decent size island and get lots of stone. Then, you build a 6-9 block wall with your stone. After you've done this, place torches everywhere over your walls and floor and get rid of them afterward if you need to build. Next, you add your roof and you can live hostile free!

Extras

- A small tunnel leading to a secondary base.
- A mine.
- Obsidian shelter in case that creeper one day gets you.
- Extra rooms
- A walled-off passage to the mainland

### Underwater Shelter
Description

An underwater base for total protection from creepers and other mobs, along with looking good. 

Necessary Materials

Any block; preferably glass.

Some form of light, glowstone, etc. Torches cannot be placed on the sides of glass, so be wary when utilizing glass for the walls.

Location

In a deep lake or in the ocean. Be careful to not build near ocean monuments so that guardians will not spawn.

Construction

Start by filling the space where you are going to build your house, then dig out the inside. Next, start removing the wall and replacing it with the block of your choice. Then, add your ceiling and replace the water on the top. For added ease build your house underwater out of wood then cover it with any non-flammable material. Now, dig one block under your house and burn it which will remove all the water. You now have a "creeper proof" house (unless it blows up the water without being in it, although this has only been proved with TNT). Make sure the surrounding area is lit up to prevent drowned from spawning.

Extras

- An underground base below this base.

- Glass walls and roofs, as the strength of the blocks doesn't matter.

### Freestanding - Hard
Description

The freestanding shelter, just bigger and harder to build and also with extra floors.

Necessary Materials

- Preferred building material (wooden planks, cobble. About 256-2048 blocks)
- Logs
- Glass panes and blocks
- Fences for patio and/or balcony
- Stairs
- Ladders (to get up or down your floors)
- Doors
- Trapdoors

Location

A large, flat area, with room for expansions, underground or to the side.

Construction

The size of the shelter is up to the player, however, the bigger your house is the more room you will have for expansion. 

1. Build the foundation of your house one block higher than the ground, so you can make a patio and as an added bonus you don't have to clear out the ground to make a floor.

2. Next, build your walls 5 blocks high so the ceiling isn't too low, and the windows don't look weird. The house will also feel bigger that way.

3. Make the ceiling. This means the inside of the house is currently 4 blocks high.

4. Make any rooms you want (crafting room, brewery, bedroom, etc.).

5. If you don't want a second floor, you're done! If you do want a second floor, continue on. Punch 1×1 hole in your ceiling. Pillar jump up on to your second floor, but as you keep going up and down you will have to destroy your pillar, so ladders are recommended here. For the second floor, repeat step 2, 3 and 4. If wanted, you can make glass skylights for both the roof and the floor of the 2nd level.

6. If you don't want an underground floor, you're done! If you do want an underground floor, continue on. Dig down 5 blocks from your floor. Next, hollow out the area you want to use. Dirt and stone don't really make great décor, so wooden planks are the preferred building material. Hollow out the wall and replace it with the planks. You can make entrances to all your expansions here. You may use ladders or stairs to get down to your underground floor.

7. If you don't want a balcony, you're done! If you do want a balcony, continue on. Go outside your house. Pillar jump to wherever you want to place your balcony. Use cobble or wooden planks. Extend your balcony about 3-5 blocks out. Add a fence and you're done! A nice extra is to put wooden steps and a sign by each side, so it looks like a chair.

Extras

- Greenhouse made out of glass (consider adding a chest or two for keeping your seeds and tools and a crafting table to make quick bread).

- Universal underground stopping point for all expansions (passageway to the guard tower, entrance to quarry or mine, iron door to emergency bunker, etc.)

- Craft Room. a room full of crafting tables and furnaces for quick crafting and smelting. Add a chest to store valuable ores and ingots.

- Emergency bunker. Creeper invading your house? Make an underground shelter made out of obsidian or 3 layers of cobble and an iron door. A bed is a must. A chest full of food, weapons and tools is needed. A workbench and a furnace are useful as well.

- Indoor fishing pond. Useful source of food if a greenhouse has not been created.

- Storeroom. A room full of chests to keep less valuable materials (dirt, cobble)

- Guard Tower. Make a tall tower (5×4) and about 30 blocks high to survey the land. Add a chest full of arrows and a bow to 'snipe' some mobs.

- Escape passage. This is a must! You can also add this to your bunker.

- Emergency kit. Need to leave quickly? Found a group of zombies in your basement? A chest full of weapons, food, crafting table, furnace and tools is helpful if invaded by an army of monsters.

- Tree farm. Although time-consuming, an indoor tree farm can be extremely useful. Note that the room must be tall enough to accommodate the trees. The room will have to be well-lit. Consider adding a chest full of axes and saplings.

- Skylight. Extra light and looks cool. Why not even make your roof out of glass? No mobs can spawn on it!

- Tunnel to another base. This is helpful if you need to go to another safehouse to collect more resources.

### Ravine Shelter
Description
A shelter situated in a ravine. Rooms may either overhang on the side or occupy the entire ravine. These are easier to build if the opening is close to (if not breaking) the surface, and more difficult if deep underground. Sometimes a ravine may spawn above another ravine, so you can use the lower as your shelter, and upper as your farm(s). 

Necessary Materials

- Torches
- Ladders
- Cobblestone
- Water

Location

In a Ravine

Construction
If there is lava on the bottom, freeze it with water. Any water/lava from the sides should be plugged. Make the floor flat, and then light up the ravine with as many torches as you can. Start the walls, and put in the items you want in the rooms (bedroom, craft room, furnace room, storeroom, minecart room). Rooms should be 3-4 blocks high (or if you're building a staircase, whichever suits the staircase best), and once all rooms are at the preferred height, build the next floor. Repeat until the house has as many rooms as you need.

You may want to seal off caves, but you don't have to smooth the walls. Farms can be easily built on the floor too. A glass floor would also look interesting.

Extras

- Surface additions
- Branch mine
- Tunnel
- Cobblestone generator
- Hidden cannons (among walls)
- Infinite water sources

### Castle
Description

A castle capable of keeping out an army of monsters

Necessary Materials

About 1000 blocks of your desired block, but you can exceed this limit if you want to.

Location

A large flat plains, a man-made flat area, or the world type Super-Flat. If needed use map editors, unless playing survival (legit)

Construction

Take the cobblestone and make a 3 block wide, 1 block long, and 1 block high base. Continue across until the length stretches all across your flat area. Then, clear out a 6 block long section for a primary entrance. Make the walls about 20 blocks high and make ladders or stairs leading up. Add an overhang to the walls to keep out spiders. Make shelters and useless buildings inside the walls. This should take about 3-7 nights, depending on size.

Extras

- Catacombs
- Castle forge
- Castle home
- Bed
- Treasury
- Castle mine
- Cannons to obliterate enemy siege weapons
- Hidden layer of obsidian inside the walls and towers to resist cannon fire
- Blocks on the outer layer of wall, covering every other slot as a reinforcement from spiders, every five blocks change the material to something else.
- Huge castle basement.
- Dungeons for prisoners that you're at war with. You'll need to be an admin to stop them usingspawnor/killto get out with/spawnpointcommand blocks (in fact, to make it a working escape-proof dungeon, you'll need so many command blocks you might as well make it the server jail while you're at it).
- Castle well
- Farms
- Execution block, something that kills you via fall, suffocation or other methods of destruction, to use on people (orvillagers) you don't like.

### Stronghold
Description

A castle built using a village with enough add-ons to become its own mass shelter. It can house many players and animals.

Necessary Materials

- Lots of cobblestone (1000–10,000)
- Water/Lava

Location

Any area with an NPC Village. The village will be a part of your home; keep that in mind.

Construction

Surround the village with cobblestone. Be sure to add gatehouses so you can enter and leave your stronghold. Optionally, leave room for some more structures in the village. 
When surrounding the village, create a two-layer wall of cobblestone. Make the inner layer one block smaller than the outer layer. This will allow you to snipe mobs outside the castle. 

Extras

- Granary to Store Food
- Quarry for Materials
- Armory for Weapons
- Extensions on NPC Blacksmith for Mass Smelting
- Modify the NPC Houses with extra furniture, beds, etc.
- Pistons to hold Water/Lava and release it when necessary
- Farms (Melons, Wheat, Pumpkins, optionally, potatoes and carrots)

### Circle Shelter
Description

A normal, circle shelter.

Necessary Materials

- 3-6 stacks of building material, such aswood planks,stone,obsidian, etc.
- 2 Doors

Location

A flat area that is over 15×15.

Construction

The same process as a freestanding shelter, but with the walls formed in a circle instead of a square.

Extras

- 3 Floors
- Floor
- Kitchen
- Bedroom
- Attic
- Chimney
- Mine

### Nether Shelter
Description

A shelter in the Nether.

Necessary Materials

Lots of cobblestone/obsidian.

Location

Nether, preferably next to your portal.

Safe construction

It is recommended to build a small shelter before you start any of your construction areas before starting to build your home, to ensure you won't get visited by "unexpected guests". If you build in the open, you can`t do this, but if you can you should.

Nether shelter types

1 - Cave home
Safest, because you build it safely away from ghasts and you are surrounded by walls. Making a nether cave home can prove much easier than building a similar home in the Overworld because you won't be attacked by mobs. The only mobs you will meet are zombified piglin which will not attack without reason. You should still be careful around them, though. You should also watch out occasional lava pools while digging away.

2 - Free-standing
Difficult, as you are going to be attacked by ghasts. Your walls must be made of cobblestone or any other block with a Blast Resistance of 4.2 or higher. Be prepared to fight at any time, except in peaceful mode.

3 - Fortress Home
This one is fairly easy: just find a nether fortress. Be careful, as fortresses will be hard to traverse. Be sure to clearly mark your designated "home" area, or spread your furniture around the entire building. Ghasts may or may not be a problem, depending on the location. Zombified piglin won't be an issue unless you attack them first. Magma cubes and blazes will likely not be too much of a threat.

 Windows 

A ghast cannot see you through glass. Thus, you can build windows in the Nether as long as you stay inside it is safe, to protect your self and your windows, you might want to use pistons to put some cobblestone in front of the window, which can be relocated by pressing a button. Allowing yourself to be inside the home safely and have a good view of the Nether. And when you go exploring you "close" the window, for in case you get hunted by a ghast.

Extras

- Treefarm (you'll have to usebone mealsince water cannot be placed in the nether)
- Mushroomfarm

## Extreme
These shelters offer the most amount of protection. Generally large and made out of obsidian combined with many add-ons.

### Bunker Alpha
Description

This is a very large bunker. It should have rooms for almost anything, and have enough space for many large building projects. It is dug almost down to bedrock so, if you build in the right area, there should be no danger of digging to the surface.

Necessary Materials

Lots of pickaxes, supplies for building traps (such as redstone, pistons, and tripwire), and torches.

Location

Anywhere that you can dig down easily from. It takes a long time to build, so you should have a pre-existing base.

Construction
First, dig a long hallway, with stairs going down 6-10 blocks every 30 blocks or so. Make the hallway big enough, so that lots of people can be in it at one time comfortably. Then, dig rooms off to the sides. If you did this correctly, there should be enough space for a couple of hundred rooms. Make rooms dedicated to various things, like an armory or forge. This base can hold lots of people and is hidden well, so feel free to build it in multiplayer.

Extras

- Traps along the hallway to kill intruders.
- Farms for almost everything.

### Ultimate Siege Fort
Description

This is basically a castle, only much, much bigger. Its walls are lined with obsidian so you don't have to worry about creepers.

Necessary Materials

A lot of cobblestone (About 100,000 to 1,000,000 blocks. So don't try to build this unless you have enough for a lifetime.)

About ⅓ as much obsidian to line the walls.

Location

Somewhere flat (it is recommended to practice this shelter on super-flat on creative mode).

Construction

To start it should take up an area of at least a 5×5 chunks. Make walls, they should be at least 7 blocks tall and 3 blocks thick, mine out the middle layer and replace it with obsidian and break the top layer (to prevent unwanted tunneling extend the obsidian layer about 15 blocks into the ground). Next, make the towers, they should be 50 to 250 blocks tall, They should be hollow, but don't forget to line the walls with obsidian. Then, make the roof. Remember it should be about 2/5 wider than the circumference of the tower. Add the spikes. If you've done it right then the towers should look like those of one of the castles you would see on TV. That's just about it, you now have your own ultimate siege fort. You can personalize it in any way you like. Don't forget to light it with torches or glowstone. 

Extras

- TNTcannons on the towers. (IMPORTANT!): If you want this feature only make the towers about 20 blocks tall to avoid the fuse range limit.

- A lava moat

- A draw bridge (if you decide to make a lava moat)

- Snow golemson the walls as guards. If you are good at trapping hostile mobs and only want to stop players from coming in, you could useskeletonsinstead! Note: Unless nametagged, skeletons will despawn after 5 minutes, or after you move a certain distance away.

- As an alternative to the above, if you're on anmultiplayerserver, you can have real players guard your ultimate siege fort.
	- You could pay real players by granting them weapons, and protection if needed.

### Obsidian base
Description

A large house made out of obsidian.

Necessary materials

- About 1,000,000 obsidian (don't do this if you don't have enough).
- 5000 buckets of lava

Location

Forest or jungle biome so the burning trees will increase the defense. Although, rather obviously, this might also be a bad thing, if you have enough materials for this thing, you should be able to survive.

Construction

Build a large skyscraper about 700×700 blocks wide. Use the leftovers for the walls. Add lava at the walls to kill mobs and to set the trees on fire. Add towers the same as the ones in the ultimate siege fort and add lava to the walls.

Extras

- A moat of pistons.
- Extra trees.

Pros

- Creepers cannot blow up the walls EVER.
- Extreme protection.

Cons

- Difficult to build.
- It will take more than 50 days to build
- It requires lots of obsidian to build.

## Super Extreme
These shelters provide nearly perfect protection. These structures are massive, and have large amounts of add-ons, not recommended for any players who are not willing to spend many days constructing these.

### The Obsidian City
The second hardest and most protective shelter in Minecraft.

Description

A city under one gigantic obsidian shelter.

Necessary Materials

- 10,000,000 blocks of obsidian
- 100,000 blocks of stone/cobblestone
- 25,000 blocks of wooden planks (oak or spruce)
- 5,000 fences/nether brick fence
- Some redstone (dust, torches, pistons, etc.)

Location

If you are able to clear all that land, then build it in a forest or tundra biome. Of course, these are only recommendations.

Construction

Mark out a plot of land at least 65×65 chunks. It does not necessarily have to be square. (The one the author built was a dome) Then, raise the walls with obsidian at least 30 blocks. Then, add a roof of obsidian. Now, you can add 5 more layers of obsidian. Once you have got that done, install a 5 block high piston-operated door made of obsidian at least 2 blocks thick. Line the inside of the giant obsidian shell with stone and wood. You can build lots of things inside there! Finally, add an obsidian 'fence' about 2 blocks thick around the gigantic structure and put actual fences on top. Make the gate piston operated. Just build whatever you like in there!

Extras

- A Mansion inside the structure!
- Lava/Water moat
- Secret entrance
- Dispenser turrets
- TNT cannons
- Garden outside the structure, enclosed by the obsidian fence. Adds some happiness to the bleak surroundings.
- Horse path

Pros and Cons

Pros

- Extreme levels of protection
- Looks good if designed properly
- If you live in this, you literally havezerofear of the outside world.
- You have lots of space to build inside and what's more, they are protected by 7+ layers of obsidian.

Cons

- Extremely hard to build
- Time consuming to build
- Easily spotted. However, this can also be a good thing as you can make it back to the base easily.

### World City
Description

Make your own world into one big city. It should only be attempted by pro pros and map makers. 

Necessary materials

A maniac amount of blocks of your choice

Villagers

A world with no mobs

A couple of real-life months

Extras

Your choice

### Sky city
Description

A giant island with a city on top.

Materials

- Any 100 blocks
- Over 7 stacks ofironblocks
- Over 5 stacks ofwood planks
- Over 4 stacks ofgoldblocks
- Over 3 stacks ofquartz
- Interior stuff (beds,crafting tables,furnaces&coal, etc.)
- Light sources (sea lanterns,glowstoneortorches)
- Miscellaneous (chests,anvils,paintings, etc.)
- Food
- Maybe aSlow Fallingpotionor awater bucket, just in case you have to go down
- Somedirtandwater, ahoeand some seeds

Construction

With your 100 blocks, build up straight a pillar and go up. When you reach the 100 block mark, build a gigantic circular platform, using about half of your iron blocks. Build skyscrapers and houses with the iron and gold blocks, maybe a palace for you to rest, inns, shacks and huts with planks- and some defense. Now, decorate the houses and the palace, light up the entire city, build a garden and a farm, and enjoy your brand-new, cool-looking sky city.

Extras

- Storage rooms?
- Spider-proof walls?
- Villagers?
- Meeting place?
- Party room?
- A wool "cloud" to "support" your city?

Pros

- Visually attractive.
- You can get a nice view of the world below you.
- It would be hard for griefers to find your city

Cons

- You have to make a complicated system if you want to transport animals other than chickens.
- Going down might be easy, but going up is difficult. There is also a risk of falling if you don't wall off the city.
- Costs a WHOLE LOT of blocks.

## Impossible
These structures take a notoriously long time to build and may be impossible on Survival mode. However, they offer perfect protection.

### Bedrock Cube
Description

A gigantic cube of bedrock that can act as a shield for an inner base. Slits in it can accommodate TNT cannons.

Note: You cannot obtain bedrock in Survival without commands. Even if you managed to break bedrock using glitches, the bedrock won't drop as an item.

Necessary materials

- Creative mode
- Bedrock
- TNT
- Luxury blocks (diamond, emerald, gold, lapis, etc.)
- A lot of time

Construction

Build a wall 100 blocks high and down to the bedrock layer. Make the base outline of a square and fill in all gaps with bedrock. Leave slits for TNT cannons. Then, turn the ground below the place where you are going to build the base into a crater and fill with lava before sealing it off. Then, build a column up and form a platform. Then, it's up to you.

Extras

- TNT cannons
- Fireball cannons
- Arrow cannons
- Lava trenches
- Air bombers
- Graveyard
- Prison
- Anything you want!

### The dome
Description

This is a gigantic indestructible dome made out of barrier blocks.

Note: Barrier cannot be obtain without commands, so this is required to be built in Creative.

Necessary materials

- Creative mode
- Barrier blocks
- Anything you like

Construction

First, build a massive dome out of barrier. This is difficult and time-consuming. The dome should has the diameter of at least 200 blocks. If you have mods that allow you to build beyond 256 blocks, the dome should has the diameter of 900 blocks. Then build a city (or a village, town, etc). You can also build a castle, palace, mansion under the dome. If you want to expand the dome city (without mods to build beyond world limit), build multiple dome cities, and connect them with roads under bedrock tunnels (so people from outside cannot go inside). Built properly, this could be beautiful and protective.

Extras

- A glass dome under the barrier dome for decoration.
- Anything a city could have.
- Castle, palace, mansions, arenas, etc. You can build whatever you want!
- SeeTutorials/Breaking bedrock.

## Innovative Dwellings
These types of dwellings are mostly to impress other players, or are amazingly dangerous to live in.

Description

This type of shelter can vary in location and security. For example, an innovative dwelling could be located within a double dungeon (with the spawners still there), built into the bottom of an overhang, or above a lava lake! Innovative dwellings are usually much more difficult to live in and build; however, they work with the map and are great for impressing other players.

Location

The location of this type of shelter can vary drastically, depending on the map, and on the player's preference. 

### Types
Jungle Treehouse[edit | edit source]
This type of house is hard to make, but almost no mobs can get you. First, find a jungle and either pillar up a giant tree or use ladders/vines (recommended.) Once on top of the tree, just make a house. It's an awesome idea to make bridges to other giant trees, to use either as a great lookout point or as extra rooms for your base inside the leaves of the tree. If you're feeling ambitious and have a lot of time, make a huge treetop village and invite your friends! You can keep adding more and more... the possibilities are endless!

### Dungeons
Dungeon dwellings require minimal preparation on the part of the player. They are small, and there is also the risk of spawned enemies as well as caverns nearby. Many are located deep underground, so they can be relatively difficult to locate and navigate to. Leaving the spawner in for decoration can serve as the player's death sentence.
However, advantages of this type of home are little setup, free mob drops (if one decides to set up as a mob trap instead), and in multiplayer, difficulty by other players attempting to locate the home.

### Overhang Bases
There are 3 types of overhang base. The first is built into the underside of overhangs of mountains. Unfortunately, suitable overhangs and ones located in scenic or easy-to-defend places can be difficult to find. Building is another problem, as you would either have to pillar upwards to excavate the home or enter from the top and use water to build on the underside of the overhang. Sand or gravel is recommended, as removing pillars made out of these materials is much easier and can be done directly from the ground.

The second type is built by making walls that go from the ground to the top of the overhang. You can put in many floors and have tons of stuff. You can also connect it to a hollowed-out mountain for even more space. The third is to find a wall (a ravine, maybe?) and make there your base as an overhang.

As difficult as this setup may be, one can use this type of base as a stealthy reconnaissance outpost, by dropping lava, arrows, or even TNT on unsuspecting players or just for viewing epic scenery.

### 
This is regular on creative, but is actually one of the BEST homes in survival. It looks nice and can be a dome if you are skilled it contains a lot of decoration and space. This is a modular home as well so can expand well.

You must make sure to use the base of the dome or cylinder as a walling material and this must be 4-6 blocks high as your lower floor remember to try to sink it into the ground and maybe connect it to a cave for a tunnel/mine. Then, make a walkway with a small hole in the middle to have as a second-floor viewing the water wonders. You can add pistons to part of the lower floor where it's above the ground to exit and do fighting in the water or underwater mining. It also creates lots of clay for you to use and is virtually fully mob-proof as mobs swim so will not be able to attack you and water protects from creepers.

Time to make: Medium dome 2–5 days, large dome 4–7 days, supersized dome 2 weeks, Corridors (40 blocks long) 2–3 days.

### Lava Forts
These are arguably one of the most difficult bases to build, not only because above ground lakes tend to burn wooden homes down, needing a lot of lava as well as the fact that returning home with a stash of diamonds could quite possibly be riskier than hugging a creeper on Hard difficulty. As the player must use non-flammable materials, such as cobblestone, players may not like how the home would look. 
On the other hand, the lava can protect against all types of mobs, allow animal spawns, and is relatively easy to spot from a distance during the night-time from a high perch.

### Ice-Stone Tower
This structure makes an interesting-looking tower, but requires a few resources. First, make a sculpture out of ice (the design is your choice) that is about 3×5×9 blocks. Next, encase it in a structure made from non-flammable materials, with a 1-block gap between the ice and the structure, like this:

Example layer























































Make sure to keep the top open. After the structure is complete, pour lava into the top. After the hissing noises have stopped entirely (3–5 minutes), use a bucket to get rid of the lava, tear down the structure, drain the extra water, and decorate your new house! Glass windows and doors are recommended. Try to get inside without breaking any blocks, only ladders.

### Mountain Bases
These bases are some of the toughest to build because they are basically on top of a mountain. You're probably thinking, "That's easy to build", but it isn't, because it requires a mountain range or at least two mountains. The idea is you link the two mountains together with 10 block wide bridge, and rooms inside the bridge. That's only the start, to make a proper base you could add a floating island around the base and make it better to look at. It's one of the toughest because it requires a lot of stone. It is suggested that you get 200 saplings and plant them around your base as well as in it. When all this is done it will look amazing and easy to protect from mobs because they fall off the edge of the mountain and plummet to their death, but it will take time to build, it takes a lot longer to build than a lava fort, but there is an easy way. If you clear the top of the mountain and make it flat, it will be easier and you can just build a simple house. Of course, this isn't as safe.

### Subterranean Stronghold
This type of base is hard to conquer (see Tutorials/Defeating a stronghold). One first has to find a stronghold in their world (a difficult task as it is), light up the entire structure, patch any holes made by caves, and then make a safe entrance from the surface. You can also use a cave entrance, but this makes it harder to find when coming home after a long day of exploring. You also must be wary of silverfish, and be careful not to break any walls. However, once you do conquer the entire Stronghold, nothing can get to you. The main thing to be wary of are creepers waiting outside your exit, wanting to kill you as you foolishly walk up and out.

Extras

- Windows by your exit are good to have, to stop the above-mentioned creeper attacks.
- Mushroom, wheat, sugar cane, melon, or pumpkin farms for food and miscellaneous items.
- Escape tunnels are must-haves, to get away from anything that could spawn in that dark corner you missed lighting up.
- You can also add a tree farm. This will take quite some time, but you will not really need to go above ground a lot.

### Obsidian Fortress
This will be a home where you shall never fear external damage. A griefer will never block the entrance with obsidian because the whole house is made of it. Best of all, it will be hidden with 2-4 layers of dirt and stone to cover it. This home will require huge amounts of time, space, materials, and hard work, but in the end, you will have everything you'll have ever wanted.

- #x#x# is length, width, and height.

The layout is quite symmetrical except for the entrance. You should find a big hill or mountain to place the entrance. The actual entrance will a 2×1×2 square of stone that will open when the two sideways sticky pistons on either side revert to their normal position. The doors should open on both sides, but the outside switch will be in a 6×1×6 hollow space surrounded by dirt that you will dig through. You then build a 6×25×6 hallway entirely out of obsidian. It should be lit by a torch once every other block on both sides. This will lead to the grand entrance. At the end of the hallway, build an 8×1×8 rim on the blocks in front of where the hallway ended. This will create a big lip around the hallway. Continue building these rims until you finish the 14×1×14 rim. You then pick a corner of the 14×1×14 rim and build another identical rim including the corner of the original 14×1×14 rim. You then build the smaller interior rims just like you did with the first hallway. You'll be going backwards though, so instead of going 8×1×8,10×1×10, etc., you'll be going 12×1×12,10×1×10, etc. until you finish the 6×1×6 rim. Repeat for other two passage entrances until the result is a big square with symmetrical entrances on each side. Put a roof on the big square that is horizontal, not something that sticks out.

- The result of all 6×(#)×6 walls is a 4×(#)×4 space.

For the remaining entrances, build a 6×2×1 floor one block lower than the original floor. Make sure it lines up with the inner 6×1×6 rim. This will be the first of 25 "steps". The ceiling will also be one block lower than the top layer of the rim as well. The ceiling copies the floor, just 6 blocks higher. Make sure walls match the rim as well. Once the 25 steps are finished, repeat at other passageways.

After finishing the stairways, decide what each one leads to. In the main chamber, find the center and make a 4×4×1 square. Make a hole to bedrock with TNT and build whatever you want down there. If safe way down there is not built, please put signs warning yourself and others to not jump in the hole.

Add-ons

- Living quarters (preferably tunnel opposite the main entrance)
- Subway station
- Farm

Projects Under Fortress

- Prison
- Village
- City
- Research laboratory
- Lake
- Tunnel to ocean

Materials

- At least 1,500 blocks of obsidian
- At least 200 blocks of TNT
- 4,000-6,000 blocks of dirt and stone
- Any needed to keep you alive!

### Self-building house
This is a house that will build itself perpetually. It will rebuild itself after creeper attacks if the redstone circuits and pistons aren't destroyed. It's a good idea to make the entrance come from underground because doors are hard to keep permanent.

Use an auto cobblestone generator (those above-ground ones that are piston-powered). Next, make a floating structure for your ceiling (the outermost block must be obsidian so you have an obsidian rim). Next, put upwards pistons on the ground under the obsidian rim. The cobblestone generator should push cobblestone onto the pistons. At the corners, you can either put a piston facing the next side, or another generator. On the area surrounding the wall, you will need a perpetual redstone circuit going to each piston. If the repeaters have the right delay, they should build your house.

### Skyscraper
Building up has several significant advantages: A skyscraper house can be seen from a long way away, provided it is tall enough. Of course, this can be a mixed blessing in multiplayer, the bad side being griefers can also see it easily. In singleplayer mode, it can serve as a spacious establishment. Besides countless rooms for storage, cobblestone generation (of course, if you do build something this big, you should have a lot of cobblestone), smelting, and such, it allows you to stack up farms in a small area so that all of them will be within chunk update range any time you're home. You can also use the roof, perhaps as a garden, or tree farm (a sufficiently large building can have the tree farm inside). You can also dig a quarry underneath your skyscraper to replenish iron, coal, etc.

It is important to ensure some practicalities are taken care of. For example, one must ensure the skyscraper's elevator allows the player to easily move between floors without taking up too much time—otherwise, it is probably best to just spread your base out horizontally. To do this, it is advised that you either install a water elevator, using soul sand and magma blocks to speed the player's ascent and descent, or a fast-acting piston elevator. Make sure a mechanism to stop the player at a floor of their choice is installed.

### Miniature Great Wall of China
Even more pointless than a skyscraper, but in multiplayer, it will be ridiculously hard for griefers to destroy it whole, and also ridiculously hard to recover after griefer or creeper attacks. Like in real life and for safety, build it in the mountains biome. First, make a 6×6 tower, then continue on the wall. Every 200 blocks, another tower must be built. You can even use the same technique used in the self-building/rebuilding house to make it even harder to fully destroy! Build until it covers nearly the entire biome if you wish!

### Huge Cruise Ship
Resources needed:

- About 10-200 thousand blocks of iron.
- Luxury blocks.
- A massive ocean biome (perhaps water world preset).
- Patience. It can take up to 100+ days to build.

- Description:
- The massive cruise ship is a time-consuming build, and you may use real ships to work off of also. Start with the hull, placing iron and then ahighly recommended stepis to hollow the hull! Then, start on the lower decks. Then, you will want to set up the upper floors, suites, restaurants, buffet, and any other touches you want. Also, consider adding obsidian between two iron layers for safety. In the staterooms, consider televisions, tables or beds, too!

Extras:

- A pool
- A spa, and shopping centers—they can be profitable too.
- A pier, which is also a great addition to a city.

## Add-ons
### 
These are often just normal on-ground homes with walls around them.

Description

These shelters offer far higher protection, and if there are no dark places on the walls or inside, then, you can roam freely at night without fear of mobs (as long as you are inside the walls), offer a place to attack from, and allows you to build at night.

Location

Large flat area

Materials

- A normal freestanding home.
- As many blocks as you need (cobblestoneis suggested) to at least build a 4 block high wall around your home (preferably higher) and a lip on the edge (optional, but recommended).

Construction

First pick a perimeter for the wall so you will have space to build in later on, then build a 1 block high wall there. After that, keep making it higher and higher until you have the desired height. Then, you will build a lip that is at least 1 block over on the top of the wall to prevent spiders and spider jockeys from climbing over.

Extras

- Towers can be included on the sides to make it look better and give a better point to attack from.
- A larger lip can be used to give a better point to attack from.
- Windows can be added to allow you to see outside.
- A ditch can be added to trapmobs, kill mobs withlava, or transport them to a lava pit (with improved mob AI, this is most likely impossible for the fact that mobs won't just walk into lava).
- Walls can be made thicker to resist explosions (not needed if the wall is made ofobsidianorbedrock).
- By building by the sea, part of the wall may not be needed.

### 
These are quite obvious additions if you are by the sea, and can be quite useful if you happen to have many bases and mines offshore.
Watch this video for an example:

| Lighthouse and Waterways (view on YouTube) |
|--------------------------------------------|
|                                            |

Description

These are built next to water, by a natural sea or possibly a man-made channel, and allow the usage of boats to travel in and out of your base.

Location

Virtually anywhere there is water, most usefully if next to a sea.

Materials

- Water (If an artificial inlet is to be constructed)
- Any material, amount dependent on the size of the docks
- Slabs (for landing boats on without destroying them)
- Doors (Optional, but highly recommended to stop your boats from floating away)
- Chests (Optional, used to store materials for voyages and spare boats)

Construction

First, pick a suitable area on the sea or dig a trench you can sail through and flood it. Once you have a waterfront ready, build as many units for boats as you wish. These are generally 2×2 squares that can be dug into land or built into the water, and usually, have a double door at the front to stop boats from drifting out to sea. Place boats in each of these and make sure you can sail in and out easily. Place wool or stairs at the opposite side of the doors to stop high-speed boats from shattering when they hit the wall. Add storage, dispensers, or anything else you want.

Extras

A harbor with dispensers to place boats and doors to stop the boats from floating away.
- You can build a redstone wire connected to a music block to be alerted whenever something is coming.
- Dispensers can be built for boats instead of placing them in storage.
- Towers can also be built instead as a lookout post.
- Walls can be built on the sea with iron doors in the water to keep unwanted guests from getting into your harbor.
- You can have several different sets of docks in a concentrated area, with buildings for whatever purposes in-between, to build an entire large-scale base around the harbor.

### Railway System
This is useful if you have several mines, bases, or other places of interest that are too far away to walk to from your shelter.

Description

These are built when you've got plenty of resources and you have need of getting somewhere regularly that is at least a few hundred meters away, or you simply don't have the patience to walk there and back.

Materials

- 4-30 stacks of rail
- 6 powered rails
- A couple of water timers (see"here"), although other timers do work.
- 2 redstone torches
- 2 track switches
- A minecart (if it's powered it will simplify the making of the stations).

Construction

First, build a booster with three powered rails (for more information, see "here"). Connect the T switch to the booster and make a water timer. Wire it up to the track switch. When you enter you press a button to activate the timer. You may want to activate the button when you get in and add a wire to the powering torch. Now, make your track and repeat at the other end. If you have a 400-meter track, you'll want a 12-second booster. You may want to build the majority of the track a few blocks above the ground and have heavily-guarded stations to avoid mobs (particularly creepers) damaging it. With this track you'll go 8 meters/second (or 11.3 meters/second, if you're going diagonally), which, depending on the terrain you're traveling through, will make your journey 50-80% shorter.

Extras

- Multiple stations allowing you to have more than two potential destinations.
- Alarms allowing you to perform an emergency launch or ready your weapons.
- Some powered minecarts (with enough fuel for the journey) to serve as engines for storage minecarts, to carry chests filled with loot to a safe place (i.e., your base).
- A system to remotely control all the stations you have built using levers and redstone wire, allowing you to make a cart go past a station without stopping (useful with powered minecarts as you don't need to start them again after they reach a station).
- A back-up in case creepers or other players destroy it.
- Stations that are effectively fortresses to be sure you're system is safe.
- An emergency armory in case your station has some unknown flaw and you don't or can't carry around arms and armor.
- Towers to snipe from (with ample arrow supply) or to make sure you can find the nearest station if you've gone exploring and you want to go home (or to a mine, library, NPC village, etc.).
- A bed in your stations if you intend to take a prolonged visit to a point of interest.
- Automated turrets (TNT cannons or golems) in case mobs attack when you are not in the area.
- A bunker with rations including a few pieces of steak, a farm, crafting facilities, and an escape tunnel (useless if you have well-defended stations and not particularly useful if you have an alarm as you can perform an emergency launch, but if you are short on resources (while the railway itself is really to be made when you have plenty of resources you may not actually have that many resources), these have use).

### Stable and Horse Path
Horses are a faster alternative to walking.

Description

It's basically a house for your horses and a path for them to follow!

Materials

- Cobblestoneorwood
- Fencesandgates
- Gravelfor the path. (any other material will do, gravel is just a recommendation)

Construction

First, build a wooden or cobblestone 'hut' with a gate for the horses. Make it at least 8×5. Next, make a path to whatever destination. Make it at least 2 blocks wide and light it! Once you get the horses, you can virtually ride wherever you want!

Extras

- Upgrade the stable, make it bigger
- Piston operated entrance/exit
- Make it a Horse shop (multiplayer).
- Feeding area with golden apples and bales of hay
