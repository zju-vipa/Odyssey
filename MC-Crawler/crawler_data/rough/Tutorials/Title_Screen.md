# Title Screen
The title screen‌[JE  only] or main menu‌[BE  only] is one of Minecraft's several menu screens. Acting as an introductory interface, it permits access to singleplayer and multiplayer gameplay.

The game's logo is prominently displayed on the title screen, accompanied with a randomly-selected splash, and is also backed with a panorama.

## Minceraft
The Minceraft Easter egg, as seen in 1.20.1.

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


There is a 0.01% chance for the title screen to display "Minceraft" instead of "Minecraft".[1] Notch implemented this as an Easter egg, and kept it as a small secret, enjoying that he was the only one who knew of its existence. After stating a secret was in Minecraft undiscovered, the internet sought out to find it. Soon after, Notch posted "A Post-Mortem of Minceraft" on Reddit.

Additionally, in crash logs, a reference to Minceraft may appear as a joke, stating "You should try our sister game, Minceraft!"

As of 1.20.4, the chance of getting Minceraft can be "inverted" by swapping the minecraft.png and minceraft.png files, as the Minceraft easter egg now has its own independent texture.

Its texture path is textures/gui/title/minceraft.png
