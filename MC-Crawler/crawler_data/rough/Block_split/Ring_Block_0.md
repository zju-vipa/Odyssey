## Natural generation
Rings made of ring blocks are found throughout Glide maps in score attack mode. Each color of ring block forms a different sized ring: 9×9 block rings are made of green ring blocks, 7×7 block rings are made of yellow ring blocks, and 5×5 block rings are made of blue ring blocks. Due to an oversight, there is an inaccessible green ring in the Body map, which can be seen (but not gone through) if you go out of bounds.

## Usage
Flying through rings made of ring blocks in score attack mode earns the player points. Smaller rings earn the player more points: green rings give 3 points, yellow rings give 5 points, and blue rings give 7 points.
