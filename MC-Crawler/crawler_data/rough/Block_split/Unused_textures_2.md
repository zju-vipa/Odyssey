#### Root vines
In Java Edition 21w05a, this texture called root_vines_head.png was added to the assets/minecraft/textures/block/ directory. This was an early design for cave vines.[12] There is no known "body" texture despite this being implied by this texture being named "head" alongside the naming of existing cave vines.

The texture was removed in Java Edition 21w16a.[13]

#### debug.png and debug2.png
In 15w31a, these two textures were added to the game, where they remain to the current day. Given their name, they are used for debugging purposes by Mojang, likely for the creation and testing of block textures and models. It appears that there are the letters N, E, S, and W on the texture of debug2, all placed at different rotations. This could possibly be used for rendering, with the letters signifying the 4 cardinal directions. 

debug.png could be made to appear in-game in certain Java Edition 1.13 snapshots due to being defined as the particle texture for bubble columns, meaning actions that would result in the creation of particles (such as falling from a height onto the edge of a block next to a bubble column) would show particles with this texture. They could also be seen when the bubble column was pushed by a piston.[14]

Despite being unused, both of these blocks were given new textures for the 2018 April Fools' update:

## Items
### Removed
#### Studded armor
Studded armor refers to four armor item textures which were found in the initial versions of items.png, alongside the leather armor, chain armor and plate (iron) armor sets. First appearing in the second December 31, 2009 build, the sprites technically did see use in-game, but this is of little significance as all sprites on items.png were used at the time, with basically no functionality. These textures were taken directly from one of Notch's games Legend of the Chambered 2.

- Helmet
- Chestplate
- Leggings
- Boots

The textures were ultimately removed some time between the 4th and 6th of February, 2010 in preparation for the actual implementation of armor and its mechanics.


#### Quiver
The quiver was another item texture which existed in items.png from the very beginning, but which persisted for much longer. Having its origins in Legend of the Chambered, one of Notch's prior games, the texture was also included among the first item sprites in the game. While it too technically existed as an item, it was also ultimately nonfunctional and only existed for testing purposes.

Its texture was changed on the 22nd of January, 2010 by flipping it horizontally from its original orientation.

- Second version

The texture remained in items.png for as long as items.png itself existed, and even outlived it, becoming an individual file in 13w02a with items.png's splitting, and still not being removed in 13w24a with the advent of resource packs despite many other unused textures being deleted.

Despite the quiver texture continuing to exist in the game unused, Jeb stated in 2011 he would not add quivers to the game as an item.[15]

During the development of Java Edition 1.9, Dinnerbone posted a 2×204960 image on Twitter[16] which could be reformed into a 854×480 Minecraft screenshot, clearly depicting the quiver as a usable item in the inventory, where it had what seemed to be a dedicated slot alongside a slot for arrows.[17] On June 30, 2015, Dinnerbone stated that he scrapped quivers as he felt that holding arrows in the off-hand felt "more natural."[18]

As a result of this scrapping, with there no longer being any planned future uses for the texture, it was ultimately removed in 1.9's first snapshot: 15w31a.

The quiver texture was also present in Pocket Edition's items.png file and, reflecting the behavior of early Indev, was even unintentionally assigned to an invalid ID item.[more information needed] Its removal time is unknown, and it was later re-added. It was also present in the Legacy Console Edition from the start, being replaced by the end crystal item texture in TU43 and equivalent versions.


#### Handheld camera
Between Pocket Edition v0.1.0 alpha and Pocket Edition v0.2.0 alpha, there was an unused item texture resembling a handheld camera, next to the texture for the actual camera entity.






#### Ruby
Rubies were intended to be the original currency used for trading. They could be seen in a screenshot released by Jeb on 21 May 2012,[19] in which the trading system was first being tested. While it was later decided that emeralds would take their place as a currency, a ruby texture was still in Java Edition 12w21a's items.png file alongside the emerald. The unused ruby texture which was present in the game differed from the version shown in the screenshot, however; both versions of the texture are shown below for the sake of comparison.

Alongside emeralds, 12w21a also implemented emerald ore as a method of obtaining them. However, the intended emerald ore was accidentally left out of this release,[20] and as such the emerald ore block instead used a texture clearly more reminiscent of something that would yield rubies as a drop. Java Edition 12w21b was swiftly released to patch this, giving emerald ore its intended release texture. There were also translation strings in the game's language files referencing rubies and ruby ore, which were ultimately removed in the full release of Java Edition 1.10:

- item.ruby.name=Ruby
- tile.oreRuby.name=Ruby Ore


Later it was reimplemented as a joke feature in 23w13a_or_b snapshot.  
- Emerald ore in its first iteration, using the "ruby ore" texture
- Emerald ore in its second iteration, using its intended texture

Emeralds were decided upon over rubies as Dinnerbone stated he had difficulty distinguishing between ruby ore and redstone ore.[21]

Despite being completely unused throughout its existence in the game files, it, like the quiver, inexplicably survived the splitting of items.png and remained in the game as an unused texture file for much longer than expected. It even beat the quiver in longevity, remaining unused in the game for close to a decade prior to its removal in Java Edition 21w13a.[22]

The texture was added to Pocket Edition in v0.8.0 alpha build 2. It was eventually removed in the first v0.14.0 build (but later re-added). The texture was also added to Xbox 360 Edition in TU9, and remained in the console editions until TU54 and equivalent versions, in which it was replaced by one of the textures used for bed items.

Rubies were also a currency in the now-discontinued game Minecraft Earth, but with completely different textures from those present in the main game.
