## Obtaining
Frogspawn is unobtainable as an item in Survival mode, even if mined with a Silk Touch tool. When broken, it drops nothing.

### Breaking
| Block    | Frogspawn           |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.05                |

### Post-generation
Frogspawn is produced by one frog that has been bred with another. After two frogs are bred with slimeballs, one of them travels to the nearest water block or waterlogged block with air above, and lays a frogspawn block.

## Usage
### Hatching
Frogspawn takes 3–10 minutes to hatch, causing 2–5 tadpoles to spawn.

The hatching speed of frogspawn is not affected by the game rule randomTickSpeed.[1]

### Placement
Frogspawn can be placed only on top of a water source block with air above it.
