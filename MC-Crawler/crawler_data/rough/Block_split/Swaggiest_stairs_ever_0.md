## Obtaining
This block is available in the creative inventory, and naturally generate in the "missing" dimension. It is also seen in other dimensions, one of which is the "gallery" dimension, although it is difficult to find the stairs hidden among thousands of other blocks.

### Breaking
This block requires a diamond or netherite pickaxe to mine. If it is mined with anything else, it drops nothing.

### Natural generation
This block naturally generates in the "missing" dimension as the stairs leading up to the chest containing the footprints. 7 stairs generate here.
