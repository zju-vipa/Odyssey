# Fence
A fence is a barrier block that cannot normally be jumped over, similar to a wall. Unlike a wall, a player (but not mobs) can see through the openings in a fence. Fences come in two variants: wooden fences, which are crafted from planks and sticks, and nether brick fences, which are found in nether fortresses.

## Usage
### Barrier
Wooden fences and nether brick fences connected by fence gates. Notice that they do not form a connection directly between the two types of fences (in the middle).
While fences appear to be a single block tall and have a hitbox height of one block, their collision box (for entities) is 1.5 blocks tall, meaning most mobs cannot jump over them without the Jump Boost status effect. They are transparent to light and have visual gaps in the model. Spiders can climb over a fence, just like any other vertical object.

A fence occupies the center space of blocks and automatically connects to any solid block that is placed next to it. Wooden fences connect to other wooden fences, but do not connect to nether brick fences. However, nether brick fences connect to wooden fence gates.[1] Mobs cannot pass between nether brick fences and wooden fences, although players can.

Additionally, if a carpet, trapdoor or moss carpet is placed above a fence, players are able to jump over the fence while other mobs are unable to, including mobs like zombies with similar attributes to players.

### Leads

Fences can be used to attach mobs with a lead.
