## Usage
Blocks of gold are a compact way to store gold ingots.

### Beacons
Blocks of gold can be used to "power" a beacon. The beacon can be powered by a 3×3 square with blocks of gold underneath it, and can optionally also include a 5×5, 7×7 and 9×9 layer in the shape of a pyramid under the original layer to increase the effects from the beacon. The layers do not have to be entirely made with blocks of gold, as they may also contain blocks of iron, blocks of emerald, blocks of netherite, and blocks of diamond.

### Note blocks
Blocks of gold can be placed under note blocks to produce bell sounds.

### Piglins
Piglins become distracted upon the player dropping a block of gold as an item, and become enraged if the player breaks a block of gold near them.
