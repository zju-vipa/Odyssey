# Waterlogging
Waterlogging is the mechanic that allows non-cube blocks (that is, blocks that do not completely fill their block volume, such as doors, ladders, and plants) to be filled with a water source block. Both the non-cube block and the water source block occupy the same space. If the non-cube block is destroyed, the water source block remains.

In Bedrock Edition, generally all non-cube blocks can be waterlogged and none can be used to displace water source blocks, although they can still displace flowing water.

## Mechanism
In Java Edition, certain blocks have a waterlogged block state that can be true or false.

In Java Edition, if a waterlogged block is pushed by a piston that is powered for 2 or more redstone ticks (4 or more game ticks), the waterlogged state of the block is removed. If the pulse powering the piston is shortened, the block retains its waterlogged state. This feature can be used in part of a "flying machine" as a movable water source, since dispensers cannot be pushed by pistons in Java Edition. Waterlogged blocks pulled by a sticky piston always lose their waterlogged state.

In Bedrock Edition, waterlogging is handled by the game's layers system. Through editing, any block can be waterlogged, as well as other features such as placing multiple slabs into a single block. In normal gameplay, a player cannot displace water source blocks using doors or other non-cube blocks to create breathing spaces underwater, like one can do in Java Edition. Only flowing water can be displaced in Bedrock Edition.

Like water source blocks, all waterlogged blocks are non-flammable and explosion-proof, even if said waterlogged block is flammable. Waterlogged blocks can also interact with lava to produce cobblestone or obsidian, although lava cannot convert waterlogged blocks to stone. Unlike water sources, waterlogged blocks are immune to freezing.

Water can flow from a non-full face, so waterlogged stairs and trapdoors have no water flowing from their solid face. Despite this, interactions between it and lava are still possible.
