## Usage
### Java Edition
Shields are used for blocking incoming attacks. Using one causes the player to slow to a sneaking pace, and after 5 ticks (0.25 seconds)[1], blockable attacks and knockback coming from the front of the player are negated. Any effects from the attacker (e.g. wither or fire) do not afflict the defender. A successful block is indicated by a sound and the shield taking damage.

Blockable attacks include melee attacks, all non-magical projectiles, damage from Thorns, and all explosions. Shields have no effect on other types of damage, such as fall damage, drowning or splash potions.

### Bedrock Edition
Shields are used for blocking incoming attacks.
Crouching (sneaking, flying downward, or moving downward in water) activates the shield. Shields also automatically activate when riding mobs, and there is no way to prevent the shield from being activated when riding mobs.

Blockable attacks include melee attacks, all non magic projectiles, damage from Thorns, and all explosions except TNT lit by the player or from a Redstone mechanism. Shields have no effect on other types of damage, such as fall damage, freezing or burning in lava. Shields partially block the laser attack from Guardians and Elder Guardians by negating the direct damage.‌[upcoming: BE 1.20.80]
