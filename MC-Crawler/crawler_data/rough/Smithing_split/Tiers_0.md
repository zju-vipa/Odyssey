## Tiers
There are currently six tiers in the game: wood, stone, iron, diamond, netherite, and gold. The tier of an item determines its mining level, durability, mining speed multiplier, damage bonus, enchantability, and repair item.

| Tier name | Mining level | Durability | Mining speed multiplier | Damage bonus[a] | Enchantability | Repair item                                                    |

## Mining level
The mining level of a tool is an internal numeric value that represents an additional restriction to breaking blocks, in addition to requiring a specific type of tool. Blocks in the tag minecraft:needs_diamond_tool require a tool with mining level 3 or higher, the block tag minecraft:needs_iron_tool mandates a mining level of 2 or higher, and the tag minecraft:needs_stone_tool means the tool must have at least mining level 1. Blocks that are in none of those block tags can be mined with any tool tier, but may still require a certain tool type.

A golden pickaxe is unique because with a mining level of 0, it cannot mine its own respective ore or material block (gold-related blocks), which require a mining level of at least 2.

In the vanilla game, all blocks that require a non-zero mining level happen to also require a pickaxe to obtain the block in item form. And while netherite tools have a higher mining level than diamond tools, no blocks in the vanilla game differentiate between these two mining levels.

## Affected items
Swords, axes, pickaxes, shovels, and hoes all use tiers.

## Other mechanics
Other mechanics in the game use these tiers for various purposes.
