### Mob loot
Zombies and skeletons have a small chance to spawn wearing any armor. There is an 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop a chestplate upon death. The chestplate the mob drops is usually badly damaged, and rarely enchanted.

Vindicators and pillagers spawning in raids have a 4.1% chance (5.12% on hard difficulty) to drop iron chestplate, which is almost always badly damaged and rarely enchanted.

### Trading
In Java Edition, novice-level armorer villagers have a 40% chance to sell an iron chestplate for 9 emeralds. Journeyman-level armorers have a 40% chance to sell a chainmail chestplate for 4 emeralds. Master-level armorers always sell an enchanted[note 1] diamond chestplate for 18-35 emeralds. Novice-level leatherworker villagers have a 2⁄3 chance to sell a leather tunic[note 2] for 7 emeralds. Journeyman-level Leatherworker villagers always offer the same trade.

Armorer villagers may give the players with the Hero of the Village effect a chainmail chestplate.

In Bedrock Edition, novice-level armorer villagers have a 25% chance to sell an iron chestplate for 9 emeralds. Journeyman-level armorers have a 1⁄3 chance to sell a chainmail chestplate for 4 emeralds. Master-level armorers have a 50% chance to sell an enchanted[note 1] diamond chestplate for 16 emeralds. Novice-level leatherworker villagers have a 50% chance to sell leather tunic for 7 emeralds. Master-level leatherworkers always sell an enchanted[note 1] leather tunic for 7 emeralds.


↑ a b c When creating an enchantment offer, the game uses a random enchantment level from 5 – 19. The enchantments are never treasure enchantments.

↑ The leather armor has a random color created by two dyes (possibly the same dye twice).


## Usage
Chestplates can be placed in the 2nd armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.

### Defense points
Defense points are each signified by chestplates in the armor bar above the health bar. 1 defense point is half of a chestplate in the armor bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player, which is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

The following table shows the amount of defense points added by chestplates.

| Material  | Defense points |
|-----------|----------------|
| Leather   | 3 ()           |
| Golden    | 5 ()           |
| Chainmail |                |
| Iron      | 6 ()           |
| Diamond   | 8 ()           |
| Netherite |                |

### Knockback resistance
A netherite chestplate provides 10% knockback resistance.

### Durability
The following table shows the amount of damage each piece of armor can absorb before being destroyed.

Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that unenchanted armor does not protect against (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits chest plates can endure.

Netherite armor is not damaged by lava or fire when worn.

| Material  | Durability |
|-----------|------------|
| Leather   | 80         |
| Golden    | 112        |
| Chainmail | 240        |
| Iron      |            |
| Diamond   | 528        |
| Netherite | 592        |

#### Repair
Chestplates may be repaired by using them along with some of their crafting material (leather, gold ingots, iron ingots, diamonds, or netherite ingots) in an anvil. Chainmail chestplates may be repaired in this way with iron ingots. They may also be repaired by crafting them together with another chestplate of the same material.

### Enchantments
A chestplate can receive the following enchantments:

| Name                          | Description                                                | Max Level | Method                     | Weight |
