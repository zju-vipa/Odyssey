## Controls
Main article: Controls
In Java and Bedrock editions with keyboard controls, the control for sneaking defaults to ⇧ Shift. The player sneaks as long as the key is held down. In Bedrock Edition with touch controls, sneaking is toggled by double-tapping  and toggled back by double-tapping . In Bedrock Edition with gamepad controls, sneaking is toggled by pressing on . Certain actions like opening the inventory can cancel sneaking, even if the player is still holding down the key for sneaking. This never happens on touch devices as the player doesn't need to hold down the sneak key.

## Effects
A player sneaking to avoid falling into lava.
While sneaking:

- Players are prevented from walking off edges if thedifference in heightbetween the two surfaces is5⁄8of a block or higher, which makes sneaking useful for building horizontally outward over empty space.
	- The player can still dismount blocks while sneaking byjumpingover the block's edge.
	- A sneaking player still falls if the block beneath the player's feet is destroyed.
- The player moves slower, at a speed of about 1.3 m/s.
	- If two movement keys are pressed at once, the player sneaks diagonally at a faster 1.8 m/s.
- Hostile mobsdo not become aware of the player until within 80% of the usual detection range.
- Eye level moves down1⁄8of a block, and the character model bends over slightly. The latter can be seen in3rd person view. Additionally, the 3rd person view itself moves down.
- The player's hitbox height reduces from its usual 1.8 blocks to 1.5 blocks.
- Players cannot hear their own footstep sounds.
- In multiplayer, a sneaking player's name tag appears fainter than normal, invisible to players more than 32 blocks away, and invisible through solidblocks.
- If players are on aladderorvines, they do not move down. This gives the impression of holding on to that specific ladder rung or vine. Mining speed is still decreased by a factor of 5.
- Pressinguseprioritizes using a held item over interacting with a targeted block. For example, this allows placing ahopperon achest, atorchon afurnace, orredstoneon acommand block.
- Players are able to interact with a tamedhorse(tamed donkey or mule inventories, also) when pressinguse itemcontrol while holding thesneakkey.
- The player moves downward onscaffolding.
	- The player can't fall through a scaffolding block hanging in mid-air.
- The player moves downward inpowder snowif they are wearing leatherboots.
	- Without leather boots, the player simply sinks into powder snow without control.
- Sneaking prevents the player from bouncing onslime blocks, resulting in fall damage.
- Magma blocksdo not cause harm.
- Redstone oredoes not light if stepped on by a sneaking player.
- Sneaking causes a player to sink faster when submerged in water or lava.
- Sculk sensorsandwardensdo not detect sneaking players, even if they jump while sneaking.
	- Sculk sensors can still detect players that stand on top of them, even when they are sneaking.
	- The warden can still "sniff out" a sneaking player's location and slowly approach them.
- InJava Edition, if sneaking is set to "Toggle" under Accessibility Settings or Controls, the player keeps sneaking when interacting with blocks that have a UI if the player was sneaking when they interacted with the block.
- InBedrock Edition, sneaking is used to block attacks while holding ashield.

Sneaking does not affect:

- Jump height: players can still jump up to the same heights and at the same vertical speed. Horizontal jump speed and distance is decreased, however.
- Farmlandand crops: they are still trampled when jumped upon.
