# Jumping
Jumping is a form of movement that elevates the player 1 1⁄4 block (1.25 blocks) into the air. Mobs can also jump, as part of their behavior.

## Mechanic
### Activation
Jumping is done by pressing the jump key (which defaults to the space bar on a keyboard) or button (for example the 'A' button on an Xbox contoller). When the auto-jump setting is enabled, and the player walks towards the edge of a block, the player automatically jumps.

### Usage
When the player jumps, a specific upward velocity is added to the player. A player always starts a jump with same speed moving upward.

** Jump height **
Jumping normally lets the player climb up 11⁄4 block. Players with Jump Boost I are able to jump 115⁄16 block, and with Jump Boost II they are able to jump 21⁄2 (2.5) blocks. The effect also increases more with more levels of Jump Boost.

Sneaking and crawling, when activated by suffocation prevention in Java Edition, prevent players from jumping due to the reduced space. These two actions normally do not prevent players from jumping.

** Combinations **
Jumping can be combined with sprinting to increase the player's movement speed. A single jump while sprinting costs four times as much hunger as a normal jump.

### Mobs
Most land-based mobs are able to jump when they are walking up blocks. However, they only jump when they need to in order to climb hills, except in (but not limited to) these cases:

- Illagersandwitcheswhen celebrating a successfulraid
- Foxes, when attacking
- Spidersandcave spiders, when attacking
- Rabbits, as part of their normal movement
	- Thekiller bunny‌[JE  only]has the same attack pattern as spiders, and jumps around similarly.
- Slimesandmagma cubes, as a part of their normal movement
- Babyvillagerswhen playing onbeds
- Adultpandaswhen a nearby baby panda sneezes

These mobs are able to walk up full-sized blocks without jumping:

- Horsesand their variants
- Iron golems
- Endermen
- Striders, when ridden by the player
- Llamas
- Ravagers
- Drownedon land
- Turtles

Flying mobs (ghasts, phantoms, etc.) and water mobs (except turtles) do not jump.

- Fishes,guardiansandelder guardiansflop around when out of water, but do not jump.

### Blocks
** Blocks affected by jumping on or near them **
- Farmlandreverts to a standarddirtblock if an entity jumps and/or lands on it. This also causes any seeds and crops planted in the farmland to pop out. Entities do not need to jump for this to occur, as simply landing on farmland from a fall causes the same effect.
- Turtle eggscan be broken by being jumped/landed on enough times.
- Asculk sensoris able to detect almost any interaction or movement from an entity. A sculk sensor cannot sense when an entity jumps, but can sense when one lands. Jumping or landing while sneaking cannot be detected by the sensor. Walking or landing on awoolblock nullifies the vibrations, so the sculk sensor cannot detect that either. Wool can also nullify vibrations that are between both the source of the disturbance and the sensor itself.
	- The vibration of an entity hitting the ground causes the sculk sensor to output aredstone signalwith a strength of 5.

** Blocks affecting entities that jump on them **
- Soul sandcauses entities to sink down by 2 pixels, also lowering jump height by that much.
- Honey blocksmake players jump3⁄16of a block from them, which is an 85% jump-height reduction.
- Slime blocksbounce entities back up to a height proportional to their downward velocity. Holding the jump key while falling on a slime block causes the player to jump just at the moment of making contact with the slime block. This can be done without suffering any fall damage. Holding thesneakkey while landing on a slime block completely negates the bouncing.
- Apointed dripstonethat is pointing upward (also known as a stalagmite) hurts any player or mob that falls on it. Standing on a stalagmite and then jumping harms the entity repeatedly. The farther a fall before landing on a stalagmite, the more damage it does even more so than standardfall damage.

** Jumping over walls **
- Fences,fence gates, andwallshave hitboxes that are 1.5 blocks tall, which prevents mostmobsfrom jumping over them. Acarpetcan be placed on one of a fence of wall in order to allow aplayerto easily climb over it while keeping most mobs trapped since they can't pathfind onto the carpet and over the wall.

** Jumping in or from blocks **
- Waterorlavaprevents any entity from jumping while in it. However, if a player is above the surface of the liquid, holding the jump key and in tandem with moving up against a block, the player attempts to jump out of the liquid in an effort to land on the block that the player moved toward.
	- Pressing the jump key while submerged in water of lava makes the player ascend in it.
- Laddersandvinescan be climbed by holding the jump key while being close enough to them. Simply moving forward into them achieves the same effect.
- Cobwebsandsweet berry bushesprevent players from jumping from them.
