Leggings can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the leggings' maximum durability, rounded down. Two leggings of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the leggings' enchantments.

1. ↑ a b c d e fAll enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.
2. ↑ a b c dEnchantment probabilities are the same as a level-20 to level-39 enchantment would be on an enchantment table that had no cap at level 30, and that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.
3. ↑ a bThe item has between 80% and 100% of its total durability.

### Mob loot
If a zombie, piglin, zombie pigman or skeleton is wearing armor, there is an 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop leggings upon death. The leggings are usually badly damaged and may be enchanted.

Vindicators and pillagers that spawn in raids have a chance to drop iron leggings, which are usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted.

### Trading
In Java Edition, novice-level armorer villagers have a 40% chance to sell iron leggings for 7 emeralds. Apprentice-level armorer villagers have a 50% chance to sell chainmail leggings for 3 emeralds. Expert-level armorer villagers always sell enchanted diamond leggings for 18-35 emeralds. Novice-level leatherworker villagers have a 2⁄3 chance to sell randomly dyed[note 1] leather pants for 3 emeralds.

Armorer villagers may give the players with the Hero of the Village effect chainmail leggings. ‌[Java Edition  only]

In Bedrock Edition, novice-level armorer villagers have a 25% chance of selling iron leggings for 7 emeralds. Apprentice-level armorers have a 1⁄3 chance to sell chainmail leggings for 3 emeralds. Expert-level armorers have a 50% chance to sell enchanted diamond leggings for 14 emeralds. Novice-level leatherworker villagers have 50% chance to sell leather pants for 3 emeralds.


↑ The leather armor has a random color created by two dyes (possibly the same dye twice).


## Usage
Leggings can be placed in the 3rd armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.

### Defense points
Defense points are each signified by half of a shirt of mail in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

The following table shows the number of defense points added by leggings.

| Material  | Defense points |
|-----------|----------------|
| Leather   | 2 ()           |
| Golden    | 3 ()           |
| Chain     | 4 ()           |
| Iron      | 5 ()           |
| Diamond   | 6 ()           |
| Netherite |                |

### Knockback resistance
Netherite leggings provide 10% knockback resistance.

### Durability
The following table shows the amount of damage each piece of armor can absorb before being destroyed.

Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken but not protected by that armor (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits leggings can endure.

Netherite armor is not damaged by lava or fire when worn.

| Material   | Durability |
|------------|------------|
| Leather    | 75         |
| Golden     | 105        |
| Chain/Iron | 225        |
| Diamond    | 495        |
| Netherite  | 555        |

### Enchantments
Leggings can receive the following enchantments:

| Name                          | Description                                            | Max Level | Method                                           | Weight |

1. ↑ a b c dProtection, Projectile Protection, Blast Protection, and Fire Protection are mutually exclusive.

### Armor trimming
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a pair of leggings, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, or diamond).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

### Piglins
Piglins are attracted to golden leggings and pick them up, examining them for 6 to 8 seconds. Piglins can wear other leggings but are not attracted to them. They prefer stronger leggings over weaker leggings, with one exception: They always prefer golden leggings over all other leggings, throwing out stronger leggings in favor of gold leggings. Enchanted leggings are preferred over unenchanted leggings.
