A diamond shovel can be repaired in an anvil by adding diamonds, with diamond restoring 25% of the shovel's maximum durability, rounded down. Two diamond shovels can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the shovel's enchantments.

1. ↑ a bEnchantment probabilities are the same as a level-20 to level-39 enchantment would be on an enchantment table that had no cap at level 30, and that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.
2. ↑ a bAll enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.
3. ↑ a bThe item has between 15% and 80% of its total durability.

### Trading
In Bedrock Edition, expert-level toolsmith villagers have a 50% chance to sell enchanted diamond shovels for 5 emeralds.

In Java Edition, expert-level toolsmith villagers have a 2⁄3 chance to sell enchanted diamond shovels for 11-27 emeralds.

The enchantments are the same as the ones obtained from an enchanting table at levels 5–19.

## Usage
### Digging
A diamond shovel can be used to break dirt and soil-type materials faster. When breaking a block, it uses 1 durability. For blocks that break instantly, it uses 0 durability.

### Dirt paths
A diamond shovel can be used to create a dirt path by using (not digging) the shovel on any one of the following blocks, losing one durability point:

- Grass Block
- Dirt
- Coarse Dirt
- Rooted Dirt
- Podzol
- Mycelium

### Campfire
A diamond shovel can be used to extinguish a campfire.

### Weapon
Diamond shovels use 2 durability when used as a weapon.

#### Java Edition
Diamond shovels have an attack speed modifier of -3, meaning they take 1 second to recover. Diamond shovels deal 5.5 × 2.75 damage.

#### Bedrock Edition
Diamond shovels always attack instantly and do 5 damage.

### Enchantments
A diamond shovel can receive the following enchantments:
