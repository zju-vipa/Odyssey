# Crawling
Crawling is a mechanic[1][2] that prevents the player from suffocating when inside small gaps. Crawling covers a pose that occurs when the player is in an area less than 1.5 blocks high.

## Entering crawling
A player cannot crawl when there is no risk of suffocation. Crawling is initiated automatically in any situation that would cause the player's head to intersect a block in such a way that the area underneath the block is less than 1.5 blocks. For example:

- Closing atrapdooron the player
- Closing afence gatewhen it is at the samealtitudeas the player's head
- Using apistonto push a block into the player
- Exitingswimmingmode in a one-block-high space
- Exitingelytramode in a one-block-high space
- Having atreegrow over a player
- Throwing anender pearlinto a one block space
- Having ashulker boxpush the player down
	- This normally makes the player sneak instead of crawl, but when it is above aslabor a not-full block, then the player crawls.
- Getting off apigwith asaddleif it's under a one-block-high space
- Having aboatland on the player's head

In these circumstances, the player automatically switches to a crawling state. When enough space opens up above the player's head, the player automatically exits this state and begins standing again. In the crawling form, the player is reduced to 0.625 blocks tall, or 5⁄8 of a block, meaning that they can crawl over blocks 0.375 blocks tall, or 3⁄8 blocks tall, the height of a daylight detector.

When crawling, the player travels at sneaking speed. The speed of crawling can be increased with the Swift Sneak enchantment.

Crawling players can still produce footstep sounds[3] and alert sculk sensors; both of these effects can be eliminated by pressing the sneak key while crawling.
