## Usage
Different perspectives can be toggled by pressing F5 (or fn + F5 on other keyboards). Pressing it once displays the back of the player, and pressing it again displays the front. Pressing it once more reverts to first-person view.

In Bedrock Edition, it can be changed in the settings; this is the only way to switch the camera when using touch to play games.

In China Bedrock Edition, it can be changed in HUD.

When in third-person view, the player can be viewed from an angle of 0 degrees (Y axis) when the mouse is leveled with the ground, up to an angle of 90 degrees when looking straight down toward the player.

In Java Edition, if the player suffocates while in this mode, the camera doesn't automatically switch back to the first-person view.[1]

A third person front view can also be seen while the survival inventory is open; the player, in this case, always faces the cursor.

Third person view camera has a collision box that collides with solid blocks, and doesn't collide with non-solid and transparent blocks. This can obstruct the player's vision with a close-up view in some situation where solid blocks are placed behind or in-front of the player.
