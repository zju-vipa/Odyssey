## Obtaining
Protection can be obtained from enchantment tables, drops from mobs that have spawned in a raid,‌[Bedrock Edition  only] books obtained by fishing, monster room chests, librarian villagers, on armor dropped by various mobs, and non-village structure loot.

## Usage
Protection reduces the damage taken from all sources except for damage caused by hunger, a warden's sonic boom attack, the void or the /kill command.  This enchantment is capable of reducing damage from sources that normally ignore the user's armor value, such as falling or magical damage from status effects. 

The formula for damage reduction is level × 4% for each armor piece, for a maximum damage reduction of 64% if all armor pieces are enchanted with Protection IV.

Unlike some of the other armor enchantments (e.g. Blast Protection), Protection offers no side effects outside of damage reduction.

Damage reduction from Protection, Fire Protection, Feather Falling, Blast Protection, and Projectile Protection stacks up to an upper limit of 80% (see armor enchantments).  However, it is impossible to reach this cap with the base Protection enchantment alone as it is impossible to obtain Protection V in survival mode.

The protection enchantment is applied after the armor's damage reduction. For example, 20 armor points provide a 4% * 20 = 80% damage reduction, meaning 20% of the original damage still gets through to the player. If the total protection enchantment levels on the armor adds up to 10, they provide 40% damage reduction against the 20% that made it through, or 8% additional protection (40% * 20% = 8%) for a total of 88% damage reduction.

If applied on wearable items that can't get the enchantment normally, such as a pair of elytra (using commands or an anvil in Creative mode), the enchantment works as usual.

## Incompatibilities
Protection, Blast Protection, Fire Protection, and Projectile Protection are mutually exclusive. Attempting to combine these enchantments with an anvil deletes the enchantment in the upgrade slot and replaces it with the enchantment in the sacrifice slot. However, if commands are used to force two or more of these enchantments on the same item, the effects stack.
