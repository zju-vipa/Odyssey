## Generation
Amplified worlds generate as many large hills and mountains, which dwarf even the mountains biomes seen in default world types, and more often than not reach the world height limit. Deep caverns often reach down to the bedrock layer. Due to extremely steep cliffs and unforgiving terrain, careless players can find it quite difficult to survive in this world type. Certain biomes (i.e. oceans and rivers) may see no obvious change in height. Villages still generate in this world type regardless of how flat the ground is, causing the buildings to generate in bizarre ways.
