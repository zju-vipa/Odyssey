## Description
Water lakes, which were bodies of water source blocks, could generate at any altitude. They could generate underground connected to caves, or isolated, connected to no other structures whatsoever. When in a snowy biome, these small lakes were never initially frozen but turned to ice if exposed to the sky.

A water lake generated with a small air pocket above it, which might result in floating sand, floating snow cover or even floating trees above the lake.

## Generation
Water lakes were common, generating in almost all Overworld biomes excluding the desert and desert hills biomes. If they selected an altitude above the surface to generate, they would generate on the surface instead, leading to more water lakes present on the surface in biomes with lower altitude. 

In Java Edition, the air pockets above water lakes were generated with cave air instead of normal air. This was true even for lakes that were exposed to the open sky.

Dungeons were able to generate attached to water lakes.
