## Generation
Colosseums generate sparsely throughout all biomes in the Potato dimension. It is the only place to find the main boss of this update, mega spud. Upon generation, colosseum always spawns one mega spud, as well as a large number of plaguewhale slabs and toxifin slabs.

## Structure
Colosseums are based on bastion remnants of the treasure room type, but unlike bastions, they don't have any variation: every colosseum is exactly the same. In place of blackstone bricks and its variants, the structure is made up of baked potato bricks, potone, taterstone, and their variants. Two blocks of chiseled polished blackstone are present as well, further pointing to the fact that the colosseum was copied from a bastion remnant. Entrance to the colosseum is usually covered up by the terrain, so players must dig their way into the structure.

A pool of water lies at the bottom of the colosseum, replacing lava from bastions. Most of these water blocks are actually waterlogged light blocks, which means, for example, that lava can't turn them into stone. Beneath the water, a 1-block-high maze generates, which leads to a cage under the central platform, where four monster spawners of toxifin slabs can be found. Maze is made out of charred baked potato bricks, which have extremely high hardness, so players are forced to crawl their way through the maze if they want to destroy the spawners.

There are no loot chests, as the main reason for players to come to this structure is to fight with mega spud. There are some pedestals than can bring players back to the Overworld.
