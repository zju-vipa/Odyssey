## Generation
Ruined portatols generate in every biome in Overworld and in Potato, both above ground and underground.

## Structure
Ruined portatols are somewhat similar to ruined portals. One pedestal always generates at the portatol, providing a way to travel between dimensions, as well as many other potato-related blocks. One chest also always generates, however the structure can be overwritten by other structures (e.g. potato villages), potentially destroying the pedestal or chest.
