# Cherry
Cherry blossom trees are found in cherry groves. Cherry blossoms have distinct pink leaves and curved branches. They also have a unique petal falling particle effect. As with oaks and birches, a cherry blossom grown near flowers can generate with a bee nest attached.

## Appearance
Cherry blossoms are formed in a way bearing some similarity to acacias; they can generate with multiple canopies supported by separate branches.

## Generation
Cherry blossoms spawn naturally only in the cherry grove biome.

## Blocks and items
These items can be obtained from cherry:

- Cherry Leaves(harvested withshears)
- Cherry Log(harvested with anytoolincluding hands)
- Stick(chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
- Cherry Planks(crafted from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
- Stripped Cherry Log(created by using anaxeon a log)
- Cherry Sapling(chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
- Bee Nest(if present on a tree near flowers)

## Planting
Cherry saplings can be planted on:

- Dirt
- Grass Block
- Coarse Dirt
- Podzol
- Mycelium
- Rooted Dirt
- Moss Block
- Farmland
- Mud
- Muddy Mangrove Roots

A cherry tree requires a 5×5 area of unobstructed space 8 blocks above its sapling to grow (9 blocks including the sapling itself). No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (a sapling planted in a hole 1 block deep can still grow). Their growth is not hindered by logs, leaves or saplings.

A cherry tree grown from a sapling and within 2 blocks of a flower has a 5% chance of having a bee nest containing 1–3 bees.
