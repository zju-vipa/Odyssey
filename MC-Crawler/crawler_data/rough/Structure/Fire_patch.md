## Generation
Fire patches with normal fire generate on netherrack. The soul fire variant generates only on soul soil.

Fire patches and soul fire patches attempt to generate in any biome in the Nether, except for soul fire patches in crimson forests in Java Edition. In practice, fire patches almost never generate outside nether wastes and crimson forests, and soul fire patches almost never generate outside soul sand valleys.
