Brewing is the process of creating potions, splash potions, and lingering potions by adding various ingredients to water bottles in a brewing stand. In Minecraft Education, brewing can also create medicine.

## Ingredients
Unlike crafting, smelting, and stonecutting, there is no in-game recipe book for brewing.

### Base ingredients and modifiers
Base ingredients are ingredients that can be added directly to a water bottle and are the starting point of all potions. Nether wart is the most fundamental of the base ingredients, as it is required to make the vast majority of potions.

Modifiers are ingredients used to alter the properties of a potion or to change a potion effect into a different one. The fermented spider eye is unique in that it is the only modifier that can convert a water bottle directly into an effective potion.

|----------------------|------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Nether wart          |      | Awkward potion                                        | —                                              |
| Redstone dust        |      | Mundane potion                                        | Extends the duration of a potion.              |
| Glowstone dust       |      | Thick potion                                          | Increases the level of a potion.               |
| Fermented spider eye |      | Potion of Weakness                                    | Changes the effect of a potion.                |
| Gunpowder            |      | Splash water bottle                                   | Turns a potion into a splash potion.           |
| Dragon's breath      |      | Lingering water bottle<br/>(from splash water bottle) | Turns a splash potion into a lingering potion. |

#### Enhancement
Generally, upgrading a potion involves a trade-off between duration and potency. A potion with an enhanced effect has shorter duration, and a potion with extended duration cannot have an enhanced effect. However:

- Upgrading the effect of a potion that has no time parameter (e.g.Instant Health) withglowstone dustinvolves no trade-off.
- Increasing the time of a potion that has no effects with different levels (e.g.Fire Resistance) withredstone dustinvolves no trade-off.

#### Corrupting effect
A fermented spider eye changes a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion.

- A corrupted potion usually does the opposite of the original effect.
- Corrupting an enhanced or extended potion into an effect that supports the modifier results in a potion with the same modifier applied.
- Corrupting an enhanced potion ofPoison/Healingresults in a basic potion ofHarming.‌[JE  only]Enhanced potions ofLeapingorSwiftnesscannot be corrupted.
- A potion ofInvisibilityis considered the "corrupted" version of a potion ofNight Vision.

Splash potion brewed using gunpowder.
#### Splash and lingering potions
By adding gunpowder, a drinking potion can be turned into a splash potion, which can be thrown to coat entities within the place of impact with a status effect. Subsequently, adding dragon's breath to a splash potion makes a lingering potion, creating a cloud that inflicts effects on entities that enter its area.

- Splash potionsandlingering potionscan be modified in the same manner as their normal counterparts. For instance, a splash water bottle can be brewed with any of the base ingredients; the result remains a splash potion.
- Some extended/enhanced splash and lingering potions cannot be brewed from their extended/enhanced potion/splash potion counterparts, respectively (e.g.Regeneration+ → Splash Potion of Regeneration +).‌[BE  only]
- InBedrock Edition, splash potions' effects have only three-fourths of the duration of the drinkable form. For example, a drinkable potion effect of 8:00 is reduced to 6:00 as a splash potion,‌[JE  only]splash, and drinkable forms have the same duration.
- Lingering potions have only one-fourth of the duration of the drinkable form. For instance, a drinkable potion effect of 8:00 is reduced to 2:00 as a lingering potion.

### Effect ingredients
Effect ingredients imbue an awkward potion with a particular effect but do not alter potion duration or intensity. When added directly to a water bottle, most of these ingredients produce a mundane potion. The exceptions to this are the golden carrot, pufferfish, turtle shell, and phantom membrane, which cannot be added directly to a water bottle.

## Brewing recipes
### Base potions
Base potions are potions without effects, brewed by adding a single base ingredient to a water bottle. Of these, only the awkward potion can be imbued with an effect ingredient to produce a potion effect.

| Potion              | Reagent, base | Precursor to   |
|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| <br/>Awkward potion |               | Effect potions |
| <br/>Mundane potion |               | None           |
| <br/>Thick potion   |               | None           |

### Effect potions
Effect potions are primarily created by adding an effect ingredient to an awkward potion, which is created by adding nether wart to a water bottle. Certain effects require a potion to be corrupted by a fermented spider eye. The potion of Weakness can additionally be created by simply adding a fermented spider eye to a water bottle, and it is the only potion that can be brewed without nether wart.

Undead mobs react differently to effects than other mobs. They take damage from potions of Healing, gain health from potions of Harming, and are unaffected by potions of Poison and Regeneration.
