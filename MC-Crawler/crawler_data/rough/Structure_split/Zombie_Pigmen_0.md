# Zombified Piglin
Zombified piglins, or colloquially zombie pigmen, are neutral, undead variants of piglins that inhabit the Nether. Zombified piglins normally ignore players, but if one is attacked, it and all zombified piglins in the vicinity become enraged and attack the aggressor with their golden swords.

## Spawning
Zombified piglins can spawn in nether wastes, crimson forests, nether portals, from pigs struck by lightning, or from piglins or piglin brutes in the Overworld or in the End. They have a 5% chance of spawning as baby zombified piglins. Zombified piglins do not spawn on top of nether wart blocks. Like other naturally fireproof mobs, they can spawn on magma blocks.

A baby zombified piglin has a 0.26% chance of spawning as a chicken jockey in Java Edition. An adult zombified piglin also has a 3.3% chance of spawning riding a Strider above lava, holding a warped fungus on a stick.

All zombified piglins spawn with a golden sword, which has up to 25% chance of being enchanted in Normal or Hard modes. This chance varies depending on the regional difficulty. The sword's enchantment is from 5 to 23 levels.

On Halloween (October 31), zombified piglins have a 22.5% chance of spawning with a carved pumpkin or a 2.5% chance of spawning with a jack o'lantern equipped as headgear.‌[Java Edition  only] This is not dropped, even if killed with Looting.

### Nether
Zombified piglins spawn in groups of 4‌[JE  only] / 2-4‌[BE  only] in the Nether at light level 11 and below on most blocks other than nether wart block. They spawn most commonly in nether wastes, frequently in nether fortresses, uncommonly in crimson forests and are sometimes found riding striders in lava oceans.

### Nether portals
When a nether portal block in the Overworld receives a random tick, there is a chance of 1⁄2000 (0.05%) on Easy, 1⁄1000 (0.1%) on Normal and 3⁄2000 (0.15%) on Hard for it to spawn a zombified piglin. 

In Java Edition, they appear inside one of the portal blocks on the bottom.

In Bedrock Edition, they spawn one block to the east or south of the portal (depending on which direction the portal is facing). Neither slabs nor lighting prevents this. "Portal ticking" can be used to increase the rate of zombified piglin spawning by repeatedly lighting and breaking a nether portal.

Zombified piglin spawning via this process is completely independent of the mob cap, similar to the spawning of phantoms in Java Edition, which means they can still spawn if there are a sufficient number of hostile mobs in the world. 

Zombified piglins who spawn in this way cannot travel to the Nether for a preset amount of time, whether they walk through the portal they spawned in or through nearby portals.‌[Java Edition  only]

### Pigs
A zombified piglin spawns when lightning strikes within 4 blocks of a pig. If the pig is a piglet, it then transforms into a baby zombified piglin.

### Piglins
A piglin or piglin brute that enters the Overworld or the End transforms into a zombified piglin after 15 seconds. When piglins wielding crossbows zombify, they keep their crossbows, but are unable to use them, and perform melee attack like other zombified piglins. When baby piglins zombify, they do not have weapons, unlike baby zombified piglins that naturally spawn. When piglin brutes zombify, they keep their axes.

The newly zombified piglin gets the Nausea effect for 10 seconds. This is a purely visual effect, and does not affect the mob's behavior.

A zombified piglin keeps any armor or weapons collected before being zombified‌[JE  only].

Baby zombified piglins also have a 5% chance of becoming a chicken jockey‌[Java Edition  only].

If a piglin is in the middle of bartering and gets zombified while inspecting a gold ingot, it drops the ingot when it turns into a zombified piglin.

1. ↑Dropped only when kill credit is given to the player

- There is an 8.5%‌[JE  only]or 25%‌[BE  only]chance to drop their original weapon if killed by a player or tamedwolf, or upon death when angry. The chance is increased by 1%‌[JE  only]or 5%‌[BE  only]per level of Looting, for a maximum of 11.5%‌[JE  only]or 40%‌[BE  only]with Looting III. The death animation does not include the weapon if it was dropped.

## Behavior
Zombified piglins wander aimlessly about when idle. They move at 2.28 m/s and are immune to fire and lava. When provoked, their speed increases to 3.38 m/s or faster for babies.

In Java Edition, like zombies, zombified piglins can attack wooden doors and may break them on Hard difficulty.[2]

In Normal and Hard difficulties, up to 55%‌[JE  only] or 25%‌[BE  only] of zombified piglins pick up any armor pieces and swords better than their golden one, which they always drop when killed. This also prevents them from despawning. 

Zombified piglins may pick up an illager banner next to it‌[BE  only] as pillagers do.[3]

Zombified piglins try to destroy any turtle eggs they see within 23 blocks away horizontally and 3 blocks away vertically (10 blocks horizontally and 2 blocks vertically in Bedrock Edition), not counting the block they are standing in. When a zombified piglin is first spawned, it always detects nearby turtle eggs after exactly 2 seconds, as long as there are two blocks of air above it. However, if the turtle egg is placed after the zombified piglin spawned, the zombified piglin takes some time to notice the turtle egg and try to break it.

Zombified piglins avoid walking near magma blocks and cannot jump over magma blocks one block high. If a zombified piglin is surrounded by magma block wall one block height or higher, it gets near those surrounding magma blocks surrounding them. If a zombified piglin spawns on or is pushed onto magma blocks, it pathfinds normally on the magma.

Zombified piglins do not retreat from zoglins, soul torches/lanterns, soul fire or soul campfires. Zoglins attack zombified piglins on sight, causing a retaliation.

Zombified piglins are not distracted by gold, and cannot barter, unlike piglins. They also do not follow players that are holding a gold ingot or another gold item.

Villagers and wandering traders run away from zombified piglins, despite them being passive to villagers and wandering traders.‌[BE  only] In addition, piglins squeal in distress and flee from zombified piglins if they get too close. Zombified piglins ignore piglins unless provoked.

Iron golems attack zombified piglins, which causes other zombified piglins to attack the iron golem. A zombified piglin is neutral to every mob that can attack, but they retaliate and gang up on any mob that provokes them.
