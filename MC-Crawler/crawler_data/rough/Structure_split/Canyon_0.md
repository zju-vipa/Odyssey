# Canyon
Canyons[1] (formerly and commonly known as Ravines) are deep and long cracks breaching the underground layers of the Overworld. Occasionally, they may breach the surface, potentially exposing caves that would not normally be visible otherwise.

## Structure
Canyons are around 85 to 127 blocks in length and typically less than 15 blocks wide. Water-filled canyons can also be found in any ocean biome. Canyons are up to 62 blocks in depth and can start at levels 10 to 72. Canyons in amplified worlds and in Bedrock Edition may go all the way down to the bedrock layer, causing canyons spawning in mountainous biomes to appear deeper. A canyon extending down to bedrock causes lava sources to generate at the bottom. Obsidian often forms at the bottom as water springs flow down into the lava.

Canyons may have small ledges along the top. Deep canyons sometimes spawn slimes or expose a diamond ore vein. Canyons may also be floored by the lava lakes at level -55 or even deeper.

Canyons can connect to caves, amethyst geodes, dungeons, abandoned mineshafts, strongholds or any other generated structures. Due to the large surface area of their walls, canyons often have water and lava flowing down them from springs in the walls, aquifers or openings to a lake or an ocean biome. A canyon that intersects a river, a frozen river or a swamp is filled with stone under the body of water.

### Lava lakes

Similarly to how lakes replace all air blocks below a certain altitude on the surface, when deep enough in a canyon, all blocks that would generate as air instead generate as lava lakes.
