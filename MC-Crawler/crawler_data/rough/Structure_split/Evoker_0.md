# Evoker
An evoker is a spell-casting illager that can be found in woodland mansions and raids, and is the only source of the totem of undying. It uses two spells to attack: one that summons armor-piercing fangs and one that summons vexes.

## Spawning
### Woodland mansions
Evokers spawn during the generation of particular woodland mansion rooms. They do not respawn after their initial spawn.

Evokers spawned with mansions do not naturally despawn (unless the world difficulty is switched to Peaceful).

### Raids
Evokers can spawn during raids by themselves or riding ravagers. Evokers cannot spawn in raids on Easy difficulty, because such raids have only three waves, while evokers appear in the fifth wave and above.

#### Java Edition
Evokers spawn during raids starting at wave five. Up to five evokers spawn on Hard difficulty. During these events, they can be a raid captain. On Hard difficulty, evokers can also spawn riding a ravager at wave seven. They may also rarely spawn as a raid captain.

#### Bedrock Edition
Up to five evokers spawn during raids, with one evoker spawning during waves five and six, and three evokers spawning during wave seven. One of them rides a ravager during wave seven.

## Behavior
An evoker moves at the player's sprinting speed, crosses its arms and does not show its hands. In Bedrock Edition, an evoker riding an entity does not visually sit down.

An evoker attacking with its fangs.
Evokers attack players, adult villagers, iron golems, snow golems‌[BE  only] and wandering traders within 12 blocks by rising and waving both of their arms while looking at their target and summoning magical fangs or vexes, creating different colored particles for the different attacks.

If the player is within a ten block radius and the evoker is not in the middle of summoning an attack, the evoker flees from the player to avoid being attacked.

An evoker summoning fangs in two circles around it.
If an evoker is attacked, all evokers in a twelve block radius become alerted and start attacking the player, even if they are behind walls. In Java Edition, the alerted evokers can attack the player from an infinite distance away, even if the player switches to Creative or Spectator mode[1]; this can be fixed by relogging the world, or by setting the game rule universalAnger to True. This is only true for the alerted evokers, not the intitially attacked evoker.

In Java Edition, an evoker is passive to other illagers even if it is harmed. Any evoker can search for and join a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain.

In Java Edition, evokers and illusioners are faster without any effects during raids.

In Java Edition, evokers are given three seconds of the Glowing effect if a bell is rung within 32 blocks of them. This applies to both evokers spawned in raids and evokers spawned in woodland mansions.

### Fang attack
The evoker signals this attack by producing purple particles () and a low-pitched sound. 

A number of fangs rise out of the ground around the player, then snap shut and vanish. 

Players or mobs caught in the attack are dealt 6 damage, regardless of difficulty. This harm is not mitigated by armor but is mitigated by enchantments such as Protection. Any evoker-summoned fangs do not deal damage to any illagers, although fangs summoned or spawned by the player do. When a neutral or hostile mob is caught in the attack, the mob attacks the evoker.

Fangs appear no lower than the feet of the lowest combatant and no higher than one block above the feet of the highest combatant. Fangs attempt to appear on the highest opaque block between those two extremes, but fail to spawn if they are obstructed by a solid block. In practice, this means that fangs cannot spawn inside deep pits or on top of high walls, but may, for example, go up a staircase if the target is at the top and the evoker at the bottom, or vice versa. Likewise, an evoker floating in a boat on water cannot summon fangs against a player swimming or floating in a boat because there are no opaque blocks from which the fangs can appear.

The evoker typically summons sixteen fangs in a straight line toward the target. However, if the target is within three blocks of the evoker, the evoker summons the fangs in two circles around itself: the smaller circle has five fangs and the larger has eight. The fangs do not seek the player, thus the player is able to dodge them. Summoning fangs resets the evoker's spell cooldown to two seconds and resets the cooldown for summoning fangs to five seconds.
