### Fireworks
Firework rockets can be fired by loading the crossbow only while holding the rockets in the off-hand. They fly at 32 m/s. Firework rockets with higher flight duration have a longer time before they explode and therefore travel farther. Firing a firework rocket uses 3 durability points per shot.

| Firework rocket range |                    |                  |           |
|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Minimum               | Average            | Maximum          | Gunpowder |
| 32m (20 ticks)        | 40.8m (25.5 ticks) | 49.6m (31 ticks) | 1 ()      |
| 48m (30 ticks)        | 56.8m (35.5 ticks) | 65.6m (41 ticks) | 2 ()      |
| 64m (40 ticks)        | 72.8m (45.5 ticks) | 81.6m (51 ticks) | 3 ()      |

Firework rockets also work with the Multishot enchantment, enabling the player to shoot 3 firework rockets at a time. The increased durability usage stacks, resulting in 9 durability being consumed with each shot.

A shot firework rocket explodes instantly when it hits a mob or block.‌[Java Edition  only] If the firework rocket has no explosion effect, it deals no damage. The explosion of a firework rocket deals 5 to 6 points of damage, with one firework star. The explosion has a radius of roughly 4 blocks, which is unaffected by the firework star's effect. Each additional firework star on the rocket deals an additional 1 to 2 points of damage, for a maximum of 11 × 5.5 to 18 × 9 with 7 firework stars. The flight duration of the firework increases the maximum range the firework can travel before exploding, but does not affect the damage output. Likewise, the damage remains the same regardless of any dyes used. The Piercing enchantment does not affect firework rockets shot from crossbows. Unlike an arrow shot from a bow, the firework does not slow down under water.
