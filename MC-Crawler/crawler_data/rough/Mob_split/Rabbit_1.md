## Variations
The six natural types of rabbits. The golden rabbit is looking at the player.
Rabbits typically spawn using one of six different skins. Skins include regular brown fur, white fur with red eyes (albino), black mottled fur, black and white spotted fur, cream fur, and salt and pepper fur. The biome determines the skin used:

- Rabbits in snowy biomes have 80% white fur and 20% black and white fur.
- Rabbits in deserts have 100% cream fur.
- Rabbits in other biomes have 50% brown fur, 40% salt & pepper fur, and 10% black fur.
- Rabbits with specific skins can be spawned using/summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType: (Number from 0 - 5)}‌[Java Edition  only]or/summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ in_desert (gold)/in_snow (white)‌[Bedrock Edition  only].
- While it is possible to go above 5, this results in rabbits with skins identical toRabbitType: 0, with the exception ofRabbitType: 99, the Killer Bunny.

There are two special variants of rabbits:


### The Killer Bunny

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


The current killer bunny texture
The killer bunny is an aggressive variant of the rabbit exclusive to Java Edition that is hostile toward players and wolves. Its fur is pure white with blood-red eyes that are horizontal, compared to a normal rabbit's vertical eyes. It can be spawned only by using the /summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType:99} command. It appears with a nameplate over its head reading "The Killer Bunny".

If the killer bunny finds any player within a 16-block radius, it hops toward the player much faster than a normal rabbit. It moves in a style similar to that of a spider. Once it closes in, it jumps at the player, dealing 8 damage on Normal difficulty. If the player strikes at the killer bunny, it runs away for a brief moment, then returns to lunging at the player. Killer bunnies are immune to the Thorns enchantment.

If it cannot find a player, the killer bunny actively seeks out and attacks any wolves, including tamed wolves.

On peaceful difficulty, the killer bunny does not despawn, despite its hostile nature. It still attacks wolves and tamed wolves, but not the player.

The killer bunny can be bred and leashed and follows players holding carrots, despite its hostile nature.

### Toast
"Toast" redirects here. For messages displayed on-screen, see Toasts, Advancements, Recipes, or Tutorial hints.
The rabbit named "Toast" using a name tag
Naming a rabbit Toast (using either a name tag or a renamed spawn egg) re-textures it to have the appearance of a black dutch, with a large black and white patch and more black fur around the face than the natural black and white spotted rabbit. Other than its name and skin, Toast behaves exactly like it would if it were unnamed. When Toast rabbits are bred, whether with each other or with regular rabbits, their offspring do not have the Toast pattern; they have a pattern consistent with the parents' original coloring prior to renaming. If the player renames a killer bunny to Toast, it still attacks players and wolves. Like the killer bunny, Toast does not spawn naturally.

This rabbit is based of user xyzen420's girlfriend's missing rabbit, which Ryan Holtz implemented as a memorial.[3]
