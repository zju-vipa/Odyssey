# Plaguewhale Slab
A plaguewhale slab, also known as simply plaguewhale, is a modified version of the elder guardian with a purple body and a green eye. It has the same width and length, but half the height as the elder guardian.

## Spawning
Around 15 plaguewhale slabs spawn upon the generation of a colosseum. These plaguewhales can despawn under the same conditions as most hostile mobs.

Additional 9 are spawned by the mega spud, when it enters its ninth phase.

## Drops
### On death
| Item |      | Roll Chance | Quantity (Roll Chance) |           |            |             |
|------|------|-------------|------------------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
|      |      |             | Default                | Looting I | Looting II | Looting III |
|      | Dent | 100%        | 0–1                    | 0–1       | 0–1        | 0–1         |

## Behavior
Plaugewhale slabs don't inflict Mining Fatigue, and their laser doesn't cause any direct damage, but it does inflict the Poison effect for 1 second constantly while hitting its target, and if fully charged, it adds the Wither effect for 4 seconds. Attacking the plaguewhale causes the player to gain Wither effect for 1 second.

### Stacking
Sometimes a plaguewhale decides to ride another nearby plaguewhale, similar to how baby piglins ride baby hoglins. Two mobs stacked on top of each other closely resemble a single elder guardian, but their hitbox is still a bit smaller than that of elder guardian.
