# Stray
A stray is a variant of a skeleton that spawns in a few snow-covered biomes. They behave similarly to skeletons, except they fire tipped arrows of Slowness from their bows.

## Spawning
A stray may spawn directly under the sky in snowy plains, ice spikes or frozen rivers, replacing 80% of skeletons. Additionally, a stray may spawn in frozen oceans, deep frozen oceans or legacy frozen oceans in Bedrock Edition. Strays do not spawn naturally from monster spawners in Java Edition.

The stray has its own spawn egg in the creative inventory.

When a skeleton is kept inside powder snow for 7 seconds (140 game ticks), it begins shaking. After another 15 seconds (300 game ticks) it becomes a stray. The stray appears with full health even if the previous skeleton did not. Items being held or worn by a skeleton when it becomes a stray remain unchanged. Unlike regular skeletons, bogged‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0] do not turn into strays, but take freezing damage instead.

### Trial spawners
‌In Java Edition 1.21 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.0‌[upcoming], strays have a chance to be selected as the "ranged" mob for trial spawners in trial chambers.

1. ↑Dropped only when kill credit is given to the player

- Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up.
- Any naturally spawned equipment, including thebow, has an 8.5% chance of dropping (9.5% withLootingI, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III). It is damaged and may be enchanted.
- 5experienceorbs when killed by a player or tamedwolfand an extra1–3 if the stray hasarmor.

## Behavior
Strays behave the same as normal skeletons but make noises with an echoing effect and shoot tipped arrows that inflict Slowness for 30 seconds on any target that they hit. In Bedrock Edition, strays that are underwater use a melee attack that inflicts Slowness. Strays don’t take damage from freezing in powder snow, but they are not immune to Slowness.

Being an undead mob, they are: 

- damaged by the status effectInstant Healthand healed by the status effectInstant Damage.
- unaffected by the status effectsRegenerationandPoison.
- ignored by thewither.
- affected by theSmiteenchantment.
- unable to swim inwater, but do not drown.
- a threat toarmadillos, causing them to hide in their shell.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]
