## Spawning
Main article: Tutorials/Animal farming
Cows spawn above grass blocks in small herds during world generation or individually afterward. Their spawn rate varies per biome. 

In Bedrock Edition, herds of 2–3 cows spawn on grass blocks at a light level of 9 or higher with at least two blocks of space above, in most grassy biomes except for snowy plains, meadows, mangrove swamps and wooded badlands. 

In Java Edition, herds of four cows spawn on grass blocks at a light level of 7 or higher with at least two blocks of space above, in most grassy biomes except for snowy plains, meadows, mangrove swamps and wooded badlands.

Also, a cow sometimes spawns inside animal pens and butchers' houses in villages. 

Shearing a mooshroom turns it into a cow and drops five mushrooms corresponding to the type of mooshroom.

Most cows spawn as adults, but they have a 5% chance of spawning as a baby.

## Drops
### Breeding
1–7 experience orbs upon a successful breeding.

### On death
An adult cow drops:

Killing a calf yields no items nor experience.

### Milking
An adult cow can be milked by using a bucket on it, yielding a milk bucket.

## Behavior
A calf compared to a cow.
A cow moos and huffs occasionally while wandering aimlessly, but tends to stay on well lit and grassy places. They avoid water unless following a player and always avoid rails and falls if it warrants damage. If harmed, cows flee for a few seconds.

Cows follow players holding wheat within a six block radius.

## Breeding
Main article: Breeding
A cow follows a player who holds wheat but stops following if separated from the player by at least six blocks. 

Adult cows enter love mode and pair off to create calves after they are given wheat, granting the player one to seven experience orbs. The parent cows have a cooldown of five minutes before they can breed again and the growth of calves can be accelerated using wheat; each use reduces the remaining growth duration by 10%. 

Baby cows take 20 minutes to grow up and follow adult cows, preferring them instead of a player holding wheat. The calf that results from breeding attempts to go to the nearest available block to its parent, even if no path can be found. A calf pathfinds to another adult cow if it is separated from its parent by more than 24 blocks.
