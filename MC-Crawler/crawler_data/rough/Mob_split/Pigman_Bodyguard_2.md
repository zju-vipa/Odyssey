### Fallen trees
The implementation of fallen trees (like those currently in Bedrock Edition) has been brought up. In 2012 Dinnerbone shared a screenshot of a fallen tree in Java Edition, however this appears to have never actually been undertaken beyond this brief mention.[21] Fallen trees have been present in Bedrock Edition since Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha in 2014, but remain conspicuously absent from Java Edition. In Minecraft Live 2021, a fallen tree was present in concept art of a birch forest, however this also was not implemented.

### Colored wood planks
Original image of proposed colored wood planks released by Dinnerbone.
                Dinnerbone briefly thought about implementing colored wood planks, releasing a test image on his Twitter page. This however never got implemented, as can be seen from the following quotes. The idea was eventually replaced with stained terracotta.

Later updates have since then introduced new wood sets resembling some of the dyed plank colors, with The Update that Changed the World adding orange and brown planks in the form of acacia and dark oak wood, the Nether Update adding magenta and cyan planks in the form of crimson and warped wood, The Wild Update adding red planks in the form of mangrove wood, and Trails & Tales adding yellow and pink planks in the form of bamboo and cherry wood.

### Colored lighting
Ryan Holtz mentioned in 2013 that colored lighting was being experimented on and might come in the future.[25] Later he shared screenshots and a video of what this unimplemented colored lighting looked like, claiming it was never implemented due to not being performant enough.[26]

### Blaze3D
A new Java Edition rendering pipeline called Blaze3D has been confirmed many times by Searge.[27][more information needed] There are also many references to this system in the game files, although it has not yet been fully implemented.[verify][28]

### Sculk jaw
  This block was seen at Minecraft Live 2020 as part of the deep dark announcement. Walking on it would change its texture, and it is presumed that it would do damage to the player and that it could be broken with the hoe like with other sculk blocks.

The block was presumed to be added in The Wild Update, but kingbdogz revealed that it was unlikely to be added in the final release.[29] In the end it was not added.

## Mentioned
These features were mentioned at one point, but later abandoned or their current status is unknown. Note that some of these features were mentioned by developers who either no longer work at Mojang Studios, or no longer work on Minecraft.

### Mobs
There have been several cases of mobs being mentioned by developers as potential candidates for being added to the game.

#### Red dragon
Notch revealed during the 8th Seecret Friday Update that he was planning to add dragons.[30] Later, he mentioned dragons again during MINECON 2010.[31]

On October 12th, 2011, he announced on Twitter that after the addition of the ender dragon, he was planning to add "slightly less dangerous" red dragons, which would be able to land and wouldn't destroy terrain.[32]

Dragons were originally planned for the Overworld.
In a Reddit thread on the same day, when questioned about how ender dragons phase through blocks, Notch went on record saying that "less overpowered" red dragons in the Overworld that wouldn't go through terrain would eventually be added.[33][34] However, the red dragon has not subsequently been added.

Jeb informed participants of his AMA on Reddit that he would add red dragons, but was unsure exactly how.[35]

On October 22, 2013, Dinnerbone tweeted that the red dragon is "shelved" and not in development.

|  | “ | It was never promised, we have no plans to add a red dragon at this time. | „ |

Later, on December 15, 2013, a Dinnerbone post on Reddit indicated his belief that red dragons likely will be implemented at some point:

| “ | I'm sure one day there will be. Not right now though. | „ |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------|---|
|   | — Dinnerbone[37]                                      |   |

This was also turned into a joke by kingbdogz.[38]

#### Alpaca
In 2016, Jeb was planning on adding alpacas, but due to other developers wanting llamas instead, he held an informal poll on Twitter in which the public voted on adding the llama over the alpaca.[39][40]
