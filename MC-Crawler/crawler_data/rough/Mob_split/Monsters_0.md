# Monster
The term Monster refers to a category of mobs that are mainly hostile to the player. Mobs mentioned on this page are classified as Monster or Enemy in the game code and spawning mechanics. Most of these mobs are attacked by iron golems and snow golems, don't spawn naturally in Peaceful difficulty, prevent the player from sleeping, and are attacked by conduits. Additionally, most are triggers in the "Monster Hunter" advancement and "Monsters Hunted" challenge.
