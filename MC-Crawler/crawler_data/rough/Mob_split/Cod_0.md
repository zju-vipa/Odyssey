## Spawning
### Java Edition
Cod spawn underwater in normal, cold, and lukewarm oceans, and their deep variants, in groups of 3-6, subject to fish spawning requirements.

### Bedrock Edition
Cod spawn underwater 12–32 blocks away from the player in normal, cold, frozen, lukewarm oceans, and their deep variants, in groups of 4–7. In addition, cod spawn only on the surface; that is, there must not be a spawnable block above the spawn location with a non-solid block on top.

## Behavior
Cod tend to swim in schools (a maximum of nine cod per school).

The player may collect a cod by using a water bucket on it, which gives the player a bucket of fish. Cod placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. When that fish bucket is used on a block, it empties the bucket, placing water with the cod swimming in it.

An empty bucket may be used as well.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

### Weaknesses
A cod cannot survive outside of water. Outside of water, they flip around on their sides like guardians for a while trying to get back into the water until, after 10 seconds of time, they start taking suffocation damage and die. In Bedrock Edition, fish out of water rotate while flipping. They cannot swim or breathe in cauldron water.[1] They can swim in, but cannot survive in waterlogged blocks, most noticeably waterlogged slabs and stairs.

In Java Edition, cod are vulnerable to weapons that have the Impaling enchantment, which also affects other fish and aquatic mobs except drowned.
