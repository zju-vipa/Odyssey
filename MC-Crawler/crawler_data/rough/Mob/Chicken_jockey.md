## Spawning
Each baby zombie, baby husk, baby zombie villager, baby zombified piglin, or baby drowned that spawns has a 5% chance to check for an existing chicken within a 10×6×10 box centered on the baby's spawn location and spawn riding one of those chickens if there are any. If it fails that 5% chance, there is an additional 5% chance of the baby zombie spawning mounted on a new chicken. Each spawned zombie has a 5% chance of becoming a baby. In a chicken-free environment, each baby has a 4.75% chance to become a chicken jockey for a total 0.2375% chance of each spawned zombie becoming a chicken jockey; if chickens are present, the chance increases to 0.4875%.

Chicken jockeys may spawn with items equipped. Baby zombified piglin versions of the chicken jockey always have a golden sword equipped, while baby drowned versions may have a trident. Although chickens take damage from magma blocks, baby zombified piglin jockeys still spawn on them, killing the chicken and leaving just the baby zombified piglin. Provoking the zombified piglin chicken jockey causes it to attack, like a normal zombified piglin.

### Mounting

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition.

## Behavior
- Chicken jockeys fall slowly and do not take fall damage, like normal chickens.
- The chicken can run through 1 block high gaps. The baby zombie suffocates unless the above block is transparent.
- The baby zombie can pick up/equip items.
- The chicken (unless spawned with commands without theIsChickenJockeytag) does not layeggs.[2]However, they can still breed with other chickens, and the offspring do lay eggs.
- Chicken jockeys (both zombies and chickens[3])despawnlike zombies.
- The chicken acts like a regularpassive mobagain if the rider is killed, but still does not lay eggs and may despawn.
