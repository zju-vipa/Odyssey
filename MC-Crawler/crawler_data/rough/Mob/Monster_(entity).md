## Spawning
Monsters were only spawnable using mods and map editors, but otherwise were not available in vanilla Minecraft.

## Drops
Monsters did not drop anything when they die.

## Behavior
Monsters would hurt and kill the player, dealing the same damage to the player as the player does with their fist. Strangely, they did not use the punching animation that a normal player would use; they would only run into the player like a zombie would.
