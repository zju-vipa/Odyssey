# Firefly
The firefly was a proposed mob featured in Minecraft Live 2021. They were originally going to be eaten by frogs to produce froglights, but this was scrapped due to the fact that some species of fireflies are poisonous to some species of frogs in real life.[1]

They would have glowed in the dark and been two pixels in size, which would have made them the smallest mob in the game. It was officially confirmed that they were scrapped for the 1.19 update in an Ask Mojang episode.[2]
