## Effect
Dolphin's Grace causes the player to swim significantly faster and lose speed at a slower rate, but also makes changing directions slower. Dolphin's Grace on its own allows players to travel 9.8 m/s underwater without Depth Strider, making it faster than a boat. Combining it with Depth Strider, players are able to travel at much higher speeds,[1] adding 8.983 m/s per level. Potentially higher speeds are possible by adding soul soil underwater and using Soul Speed-enchanted boots, along with Speed status effect.

| Depth Strider level | Speed(m/s) |
|---------------------|------------|
| None                | 9.800      |
| I                   | 18.783     |
| II                  | 27.767     |
| III                 | 36.75      |

Dolphin's Grace only affects horizontal movement speed. Vertical movement is not affected.[2]

This status effect is exclusive to Java Edition. Although players in Bedrock Edition are also able to experience a significant gain in speed if the same conditions as in Java Edition are met, it is not considered a status effect as no effect icon is shown.

Invisibility reduces the range dolphins give this effect based on the amount of armor the player is wearing.
