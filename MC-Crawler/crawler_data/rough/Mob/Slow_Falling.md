## Mechanics
The affected entity falls at a much slower rate than normal, and is immune to fall damage. However, the entity still takes damage from using an ender pearl. In addition, the entity cannot turn farmland into dirt by jumping on it.

Higher levels do not decrease fall speed further.

Effects on certain activities:

- Sprinting with the Slow Falling effect allows theplayerto jump across a gap of 5 blocks (6 blocks with enough momentum), compared to 4 (5 blocks with enough momentum) blocks normally.
- Unboosted elytra flight is twice as efficient, but four times slower. Boosts work at normal speed, but the momentum gained doesn't last as long.
- The player cannot land a critical hit while having this effect.[1]
