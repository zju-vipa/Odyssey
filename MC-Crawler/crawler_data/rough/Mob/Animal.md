# Animal
The term Animal refers to a category of mobs that are mainly based on real life animals. Mobs mentioned on this page are classified as Animal or WaterAnimal in the game code. Many other mobs and even some blocks are also based on real life animals, but are not treated as such in Minecraft. Most of these mobs are also called animals in many advancements. The blocks are not listed on this page.

Animals are usually either passive (fleeing) or neutral (fighting), with the only exception being the hostile Hoglin.
