## Classification
Arthropods take extra damage and receive Slowness IV when hit with a weapon enchanted with Bane of Arthropods. All arthropods except bees have a unique death animation; they flip 180 degrees instead of the usual 90 degrees for other mobs.

All of these mobs are also part of the arthropod entity tag.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5]
