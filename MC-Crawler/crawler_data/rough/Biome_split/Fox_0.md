# Fox
A fox is a neutral mob that spawns in cold and snowy forested biomes. They are able to carry a single item in their mouth, but prefer food over other items.

## Spawning
Foxes spawn in groups of two to four, and can spawn on grass, coarse dirt, podzol, snow blocks, and snow. 5% of them spawn as babies.

Foxes have two color variants, red and snow, which depend on the biome they spawn in. Red foxes spawn in taigas, old growth pine taigas, and old growth spruce taigas, while snow foxes spawn in groves and snowy taigas.

When bred, the color of the baby fox that is spawned depends on the color of its parents, regardless of the biome it is born in.

### Holding items
Foxes have a 20% chance to spawn (via spawn egg or naturally) with one of the following items in their mouth:

| Item          | Chance |     |
|---------------|--------|-----|
|               | JE     | BE  |
| Emerald       |        | 5%  |
| Rabbit's Foot |        | 10% |
| Rabbit Hide   |        | 10% |
| Egg           | 15%    | 20% |
| Wheat         |        | 20% |
| Leather       |        | 20% |
| Feather       | 20%    | 15% |

## Drops
An adult fox drops 1–2‌[JE  only]/1–3‌[BE  only] experience orbs when killed by a player or tamed wolf. Upon successful breeding, 1–7 are dropped. Killing a baby fox yields no experience. 

Foxes always drop any item they pick up and are still holding (they cannot drop food that they have eaten, for example) and drop items they spawn with naturally with a 100% chance, so:

| Drop          | Chance |    |
|---------------|--------|----|
|               | JE     | BE |
| Emerald       |        | 1% |
| Rabbit's Foot |        | 2% |
| Rabbit Hide   |        | 2% |
| Egg           | 3%     | 4% |
| Wheat         |        | 4% |
| Leather       |        | 4% |
| Feather       | 4%     | 3% |

If a fox is killed while holding a totem of undying, then the fox consumes the totem and revives itself instead of dropping the totem.

## Behavior
Foxes occasionally make loud screeches during nighttime, unless a trusted player is near them. Baby foxes follow adult foxes.

During the night, foxes sometimes go to villages. White foxes go to snow villages and red foxes go to any other type of village, most often taiga villages since foxes spawn in the taiga biome.

Foxes flee from nearby wolves, polar bears or players unless the player is trusted or approaches them while sneaking. They take no damage or speed reduction while moving through sweet berry bushes.

Foxes attack chickens, rabbits, cod, salmon and tropical fish, and baby turtles while they are on land. Foxes don't attack wolves, polar bears, zoglins, "Johnny" vindicators, wardens or goats even if they are being attacked by them.

Foxes attack either by running against or by pouncing. Like rabbits and goats, foxes can pounce more than one block high without status effects or player input. A fox prepares to pounce by tilting and lowering its head and lowering its body to become shorter. Then it leaps two blocks into the air, jumping over fences and walls if needed. If the target mob moves from its location during this sequence, the pounce misses the target. In Bedrock Edition, foxes also shake side to side before pouncing and their legs wave while in midair.

While foxes are capable of jumping over fences and walls, they cannot see through them.[1] A fox does not try to attack a mob on the same y-level if there is a fence between them.

Red foxes prefer to attack chickens, rabbits and baby turtles, all of which are on land, over cod, salmon, and tropical fish; conversely, snow foxes prefer to attack cod, salmon and tropical fish over land-dwelling creatures.

A fox that pounces into a snow layer becomes momentarily stuck, remaining face-down, emitting particles while shaking, and returning to normal shortly after.

Foxes swim to attack fish in water for food. Baby foxes following adults into the water cannot swim and may eventually drown.

Foxes attempt to run toward the closest attackable mob, even if attached to a lead, but do not attempt to break the lead. A fox wakes up from sleeping to attack a mob.

Wild wolves are aggressive toward foxes when within 18‌[JE  only]/16‌[BE  only] blocks. In Java Edition, adult polar bears also sneak toward foxes to attack them; in Bedrock Edition adult polar bears attack foxes within 16 blocks. In Java Edition, baby polar bears, though normally passive to players, also attempt to attack foxes within 16 blocks or when their adult polar bear attacks one.
