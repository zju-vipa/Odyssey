## Appearance
Jungle trees come in several different variants with different properties:

- Regular jungle are short, lack branches, and have a 1×1 trunk. Theleavesof these trees are arranged the same way as thebirch tree leaf arrangement.Cocoa podsoccasionally generate on the sides of regular jungle trees.
- Mega jungle trees grow branches (logs connected horizontally, vertically or diagonally to the trunk or other branches). Most of the time, a single tree has between one and six branches, and each branch has between one and sixlogs. The trunk covers a 2×2 space on the ground.
- Jungle bushes have only 1–2 logs and a few leaves. They are typically 1–3 layers tall and cover the floor of jungle biomes. InJava Edition, they consist of oak leaves and a jungle log[1], while inBedrock Edition, they consist of jungle leaves and a jungle log.

## Generation
The jungle tree variants generate naturally in the indicated biomes:

| Biome         | Jungle | Mega Jungle | Jungle Bush |
|---------------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Bamboo Jungle |        |             |             |
| Jungle        |        |             |             |
| Sparse Jungle |        |             |             |

A large jungle tree always generates with dirt under its trunk, even if it spawns partly or wholly over air or water blocks.

## Blocks and items
These items can be obtained from all variants of jungle tree, except that saplings cannot be obtained from a bush:

- Jungle Log(harvested with any tool including hands)
- Jungle Leaves(harvested with shears, or a silk touch axe)
- Stick(chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
- Jungle Planks(created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
- Vines(harvested withshears)
- Stripped Jungle Log(created byusinganaxeon a log)
- Jungle Sapling(low chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
- Mushrooms‌[Bedrock Edition  only](if present on a fallen log)
- Oak Leaves‌[Java Edition  only](harvested withshears)

When jungle tree leaves decay or are destroyed, a jungle sapling drops 2.5% (1⁄40) of the time – half the chance of other tree leaves.

## Planting
Jungle tree saplings can be planted on:

- Dirt
- Grass Block
- Coarse Dirt
- Podzol
- Mycelium
- Rooted Dirt
- Moss Block
- Farmland
- Mud
- Muddy Mangrove Roots

When planted in grass or dirt, a jungle sapling grows into a jungle tree with a 1×1 trunk, but the player can place saplings in a 2×2 formation and they grow into a jungle tree with the 2×2 trunk found naturally in the jungle biome.

1×1 jungle trees require a 3×3 column of unobstructed space at least 5 blocks above the sapling to grow (6 blocks including the sapling itself). Additionally, 1×1 jungle trees require 5×5 layers without obstruction for the top 3 layers of its final height. No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (a sapling planted in a hole 1 block deep still grows).

In order to grow a 2×2 jungle tree, four saplings must be placed adjacent to each other in a square. For growth to succeed, there must be no blocks adjacent (even diagonally) to the north-western side up to the final height of the tree. Bone meal can be used on any of the saplings to accelerate growth.

2×2 jungle trees require a 5×5 column of unobstructed space at least 11 blocks above the saplings to grow (12 blocks including the saplings themselves). This column is centered on the northwestern sapling. A 3×3 area is required at the base of the tree (the level of the saplings). They can grow up to 32 blocks high.

If planted by the player, 1×1 jungle trees do not generate with vines, while 2×2 jungle trees do. 2×2 jungle trees cannot grow side by side because the vines break the space clearance requirement.

- Small bush-like jungle trees.

## Other variant jungle trees

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition and  Minecraft Education. 


In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree. Both of these generate naturally, and can be grown out of normal saplings.[2][3]

### Dying trees
A dying jungle tree has the standard growth pattern of any other tree, although all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with vines.

### Fallen jungle trees
A fallen jungle tree may consist of a single upright log, or a stump. Logs lying on their side are often found 1–2 blocks from the stump. They occasionally have mushrooms on top.

A fallen jungle tree has a log length of 4–11 blocks. Vines cover 75% of the stump.


## Foliage colors

Main article: Tint § Foliage
Depending on where the tree generates, the color of the leaves may differ. For example, a jungle tree's leaves are normally bright deep green in the jungle, but they have a beige tint in badlands biomes.

Leaves are checked individually for biome coloration rather than as part of a larger tree; as such, trees that were grown between biomes usually have multiple shades on each side.
