### Movement

Standing tamed wolves wander randomly when near their owner, but follow if more than 10 blocks away and teleport to a nearby free block (if any) if more than 12 blocks away. Besides making travel easier, teleportation can be used to rescue them from lava, water or pits, as they immediately teleport to a safe area.

- Wolves can be told to "sit" by pressinguseon them and made to stand again with another press ofuse.
	- A wolf automatically sits when first tamed.‌[Java Edition  only]
	- While sitting, they do not follow the player. However, if their owner fights a mob near them, they are still likely to join the fight. When the fight is over, they go back to sitting (if in water, they do not sit until they are on dry land, telling the wolf to sit makes it stand). They sit at their new location instead of returning to wherever they were previously.
	- Wolves stand up and follow the player if it is pushed into water or injured while sitting.
- Wolves can either attack (within 16 blocks) or flee (within 24 blocks) fromllamas. The wolves' speed is increased by 50% whereas they flee.
- Wolves find paths to their targets if attacking within 16 blocks, even in difficult terrain. They also navigate along the edges of cliffs and occasionally fall far enough to takedamageif they leap.
- Wolves attack their targets running about at the player's walking speed and by leaping at them in exactly the same manner asspiders, but cause no damage while in midair. Tamed wolves attack any animal the player starts to attack. They also can navigate and turn around in 1×1 horizontal tunnels.
- After emerging from water, a wolf shakes the water off their fur. This is represented by an animation and waterparticles.

### Teleportation
Tamed wolves teleport to their owner if they are more than 12 blocks away, with a few caveats.

- Teleporting resets the focus of a tamed wolf, so if a wolf is attacking a mob and teleports beside a player, it resumes following the player, as its tracking has been reset.
- It is possible for tamed wolves to teleport to an inaccessible location (e.g. underice) and be injured or die ofsuffocationas a result. This happens when the wolf considerstransparentblocks, such as glass, orhalf-blocks, to be open.
- It cannot teleport when it is sitting.

An angry or untamed wolf does not teleport.

Tamed wolves do not teleport if:

- The wolf has been ordered to sit.[4]
	- Exception: The wolf is likely to teleport if it is injured while sitting (it no longer sits after teleporting). An example is if a wolf that is sitting is hit by another player, it teleports to their owner.
	- Exception: If the wolf is in a loadedchunk, and the player gets damaged by a mob, there's a chance for the wolf to stop sitting, causing them to teleport if the player is far away, then attacking the player's attacker and sitting down afterward.
- The wolf is chasing after askeleton. This can lead to wolves standing and jumping in one place, such as over a cavern if a skeleton is near. The wolf teleports once the skeleton is killed.
- The wolf is in aminecartor aboat.
- The wolf has been attached to a fence post with a lead.
- The wolf is in an unloadedchunk.
- None of the blocks on the edge of a 5×1×5 region centered on the player aretransparentblockswith a solid block below and another transparent block above.
- The player is in another dimension; a wolf remains in its current dimension until the player returns. However, wolves can be transported to another dimension by pushing them into the portal first.
- The owner is not directly touching the ground (e.g. usingelytra, swimming, flying, in aboat).

Wolf teleportation is completely silent.[5]

### 
Many tamed wolves sitting.

A wolf can be tamed by feeding it bones. Once tamed, a wolf does not accept any more bones. Note that the number of bones required is random – each bone has a 1⁄3 chance of taming the wolf.[6] If the wolf is tamed, it receives a red collar and, in Java Edition, sits if not swimming. There is no limit[7] to the number of wolves the player can tame.

A wolf's tail rises and lowers depending on its health. The exact health of an individual wolf can be determined by measuring the angle between its hind legs and tail. The angle indicates the percentage of health that the wolf has. Tamed wolves whine when they have low health (below 10). Wild wolves have a maximum health of 8, so their tails always remain significantly lower than those of tamed wolves. Tamed wolves can be healed by feeding them any sort of meat (excluding fish and rabbit stew‌[Java Edition  only]); listed below, this restores as much of the wolf's health as the same food would restore hunger points when eaten by the player.

The wolf cannot be tamed if it is hostile or already tamed.

Wolves that are tamed by the same player can accidentally attack each other while attacking another mob, leading to a fight.

Wolves do not get food poisoning, so they can freely eat rotten flesh, pufferfish or raw chicken. Feeding a tamed wolf that is already at full health usually starts the "love mode" animation.

A tamed wolf's necklace/collar color can be changed by using a dye on the wolf.
