### Mob Vote
See also: Mob Vote

The three options for the mob vote.
As with MINECON Earth 2017 and Minecraft Live 2020, viewers were able to vote for a new mob to be added to the game in a future update. Each mob received its own video justifying its inclusion.

The mobs that were on the vote were the glare, allay, and the copper golem.

- Theglare[3][4]would have been a small ghost-like mob that would have been able to alert players to an area that is dark enough for hostile mobs to spawn in.

- Theallay[5][6]is a small fairy-like mob that is able to collect greater amounts of an item that is given to it. It picks up dropped items in loaded chunks and is able to carry up to a stack at a time,[7]and is not able to duplicate items[8]or take items out of chests.[9]It drops the items that it collects when in range to theplayer, but can also return items to anote block[5]that has been played.

- Thecopper golem[10]would have been a small robot-like mob that would have been created with copper. It would have been attracted to copper buttons, which would also come with the golem had it won.[10]According to Ulraf on Twitter, the copper golem would have the oxidation removed with either an axe,[11]or being struck by lightning.[12]It would also have turned into a statue at full oxidation.[13]

The mobs that lost the mob vote are shelved indefinitely, and may or may not be added in the future.[14]

#### Results
Voting took place in two rounds. The losing mob, the glare, was eliminated from consideration in the second round. The winner of the the second and final round was the allay.
