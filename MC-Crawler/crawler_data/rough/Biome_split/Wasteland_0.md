## Description
No trees generate in the wasteland. Surface of this biome is covered in a variety of blocks, including peelgrass and corrupted peelgrass blocks, slime blocks, as well as green, gray and light gray blocks of potato peels. Brown and red mushrooms, potato flowers and normal potato plants grow on top of peelgrass blocks.

All water in wasteland, either naturally generated or placed by players, is poisonous: all entities in it (except toxifins and plaguewhales) are given the Poison effect for 2 seconds. Rain in wasteland has the same effect. Water placed inside of a cauldron is not poisonous.

Water that naturally generates in the wasteland biome is replaced with waterlogged light blocks, causing the water to glow.

Many terrain features are unique to wastelands. These include:

- "Large potato columns" - columns of blocks of black potato peels, based onlarge basalt columns.

- "Large potatostone" - a spire ofterre de pommewith varying height, based onlarge dripstone.

- "Small debris columns" - a small column ofancient debris.

- "Twisted potato" - apowerful potatowithweak rootsgrowing from it.

The following mobs are naturally spawned here:

| Mob                     | Spawn weight    | Group size       |
|-------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
|                         |                 | Monster category |
| Toxifin Slab            | $\frac{25}{45}$ | 1–4              |
| Giant[note 1]           | $\frac{10}{45}$ | 1–4              |
| Slime                   | $\frac{5}{45}$  | 1–2              |
| Wither Skeleton[note 2] | $\frac{5}{45}$  | 1                |

1. ↑Giants can’t actually spawn, since they simultaneously require a light level greater than 11 and less than 8.
2. ↑Due to how bright this biome is, chances for the wither skeleton to find a valid spawn location are very low.
