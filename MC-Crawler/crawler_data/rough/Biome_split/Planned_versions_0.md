### Combat changes
Main article: Java Edition Combat Tests
The combat system is planned to be reworked in a future update, keeping the cooldown but only allowing the player to attack when fully charged. It is not known yet when those changes will be made, as they are developed in parallel to other features and will make it into the game "when they're good enough". The update in which they are included will also not be a combat-themed update.[1]
