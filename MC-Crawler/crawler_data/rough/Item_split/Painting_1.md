### Unused paintings
In v0.5.0 alpha, with the addition of paintings to Pocket Edition, four unused 32×32 paintings were present in kz.png which remained unused. See Bedrock Edition unused features § Paintings for more information. They were also added to Java Edition in snapshot 22w16a. They cannot be placed by default, but can be summoned by commands (such as /summon painting ~ ~ ~ {variant:"water"}) or through a a datapack. They can also be obtained directly from the Operator Utilities tab in the Creative inventory.‌[Java Edition  only]

According to Helen Zbihlyj,[5] these paintings were originally added "as part of a Pocket Edition promo map" (no footage found) which was planned to be a part of Pocket Edition promotion at MINECON 2012 or 2013 and have never been used in game. The artist of these paintings remains unknown.
