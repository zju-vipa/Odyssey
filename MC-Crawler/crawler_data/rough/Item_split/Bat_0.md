## Spawning
Bats can spawn in groups of 8‌[JE  only]/2‌[BE  only] in the Overworld at a light level of 3 or less on opaque blocks below layer 63. They also need at least 2 air blocks (or alternatively, a top trapdoor or top slab in the block above foot level). In Java Edition, between October 20 and November 3, they require a light level of 6 or less to spawn. On Superflat worlds, bats spawn below the top non-air layer, ignoring the usual layer-63 limitation.

## Drops
### On death
Bats do not drop any items or experience upon death.

## Behavior
Bats often fly around aimlessly, squeaking randomly. Their flight pattern tends to favor the east, and sometimes they may fly into lava and catch on fire.[2]

Bats hang upside down on the underside of a solid block when idle, though they cannot hang on transparent or non-solid blocks. During this state, they squeak far less and occasionally turn to face different directions. They remain in this state until they are disturbed; if a player approaches a bat hanging upside down, even if the player is invisible, it flies away. This also happens if the player breaks the block the bat is hanging from. 

Bats despawn when too far away from the player (over 32 blocks away).

Bats' collision boxes do not interact with the player or redstone components‌[Java Edition  only].
