## Obtaining
A boat with chest can be directly retrieved by attacking it, as it drops itself in item form, along with its contents.

Tools and weapons with damage above 4 can instantly destroy a boat with chest in one hit.‌[Java Edition  only] Critical hits are not applied to boats although the particles suggest otherwise.

## Usage
A boat with chest can be used for the transportation of players, mobs and items, or as fuel when smelting.

### Fuel
A boat with chest can be used as fuel in a furnace, lasting 60 seconds and smelting up to 6 items.

### Transportation
Main article: Boat § Transportation
Boats with chests can carry only one entity while regular boats can carry up to two.

## Behavior
All types of boats with chests.
Main article: Boat § Behavior
Boats with chests share most behaviors with boats.

### Item storage
The GUI of a boat with chest.
The inventory of the boat with chest has the same amount of slots as a single chest. Its inventory can be accessed by sneaking and interacting with the boat with chest, interacting with the part of the boat with chest that actually contains the chest while another player or entity is inside the boat, or by opening the player's inventory while inside the boat. This means that the player cannot access armor slots without exiting the boat.

When a boat with chest moves above, underneath, or beside a hopper, its inventory is filled or drained accordingly. Due to the size of its hitbox, a boat with chest can be placed above up to 9 hoppers, allowing it to evenly split its items nine ways.

### Piglin
As with other chests, opening or breaking a boat with chest causes nearby piglin(s) to attack the player.
