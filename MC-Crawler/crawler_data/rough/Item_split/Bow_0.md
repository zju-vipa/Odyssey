A bow can be combined with another bow in an anvil, preserving the enchantments of both.

### Mob loot
#### 
Skeletons, strays, bogged and illusioners‌[JE  only] have an 8.5% chance of dropping a normal or enchanted bow on death when killed by a player or a tamed wolf. 

The chance of dropping a bow is increased by 1% per level of Looting, allowing up to an 11.5% chance of dropping. 

The chance of being enchanted depends on the difficulty level, but the random enchantment level (5–22) does not. 

Bows of skeleton traps are always enchanted at a random level from 5 to 23. The exact level depends on regional difficulty, as on Easy it is always a level-5 enchantment.

### Trading
Apprentice-level fletcher villagers sell bows for 2 emeralds as part of their trades.

Expert-level fletcher villagers sell enchanted bows for 7–21 emeralds as part of their trades. The enchantment level is equal to enchant level 5–19.

### Fishing
Bows have a chance of being caught by fishing. When caught, the bow may be damaged and contain random enchantments equivalent to a level 30 enchantment from an enchanting table, including treasure enchantments like Mending.

## Usage
### Weapon


Bows can be drawn back by using them. In order to use a bow, the player must have at least one arrow in their inventory or be in Creative mode. The arrow that is shown inside the bow always looks like a regular arrow, regardless of what kind of arrow is actually being shot from the bow.[1]

When drawing a bow, the display zooms in slightly. Charging the bow to its maximum causes it to visually shake as an indicator. Releasing the button shoots an arrow. Drawing a bow can be canceled by switching to another hotbar slot while holding use.

While the bow is being charged or remains fully charged, the player is forced to move at sneaking speed, unless they are riding a horse, minecart or boat, or flying with elytra. It is not possible to sprint while charging a bow or holding a drawn bow. When the bow is released, normal motion resumes although any prior sprint is cancelled. Sneaking while drawing the bow makes the player move even slower.

If an arrow hits another player, the player that shoots the arrow hears a high-pitched "ding" sound.‌[Java Edition  only]

Fully charged shots launch critical arrows that have a trail of particles behind them and deal up to (3x2)+2 damage, where x is the damage after any enchantments. The listed values below describe maximum damage from a bow with no Power enchantments, assuming the target is at a distance where drag and gravity are negligible. However, the critical damage is likely to be more around 8–10; critical damage is added at a random value between x and (3x2)+2 and it is rare to have minimum or maximum values. The damage dealt can ultimately be less than the maximum damage if the arrow slows down after being shot. 

| Charging time            | Maximum attack damage |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| 0.1 s(no charge)         | 1                     |
| 0.2–0.9 s(medium charge) | 5                     |
| 1+ s(full charge)        | 6                     |
| 1+ s(critical)           | 11× 5.5               |

The game stores the damage of arrows even in values with a decimal point. For example, it is possible for a critical arrow shot to cause damage values such as 6.4. In this cases of a broken value, the game can round up or down and store the amount for subsequent damage sources.

Any projectile thrown by the player is under the influence of momentum in current versions of Minecraft. Naturally, the player's movement speed can be modified under a number of circumstances, affecting the ballistic trajectory of projectiles, and as a result, the damage inflicted by arrows.

In Java Edition Combat Tests, to avoid sniping, arrows shot from fully-charged bows become non-critical if held drawn back for longer than three seconds. Instantaneous effects on tipped arrows are scaled by 1/8, just like the duration of other effects. For example, Instant Damage I arrow deals an additional 0.75 × 0.375 magical damage.

Damage caused by the arrow is not affected by the Strength effect.

Few mobs cannot be shot using an arrow, because the arrow either disappears or it gets deflected. This includes:

- Endermen- even while immobile, the enderman is immune to damage from arrows. However, an arrow shot from a bow enchanted withFlamecan ignite the enderman;
- Breeze‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0];
- Witherunder half health, when it gains wither armor;
- Closedshulkers;
- Ender dragon, while sitting on top of theexit portal.

Also, a shield can block any attack from the bow.
