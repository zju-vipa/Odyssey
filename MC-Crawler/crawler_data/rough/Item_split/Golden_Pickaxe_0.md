Repair & NameDamaged Golden Pickaxe
A golden pickaxe can be repaired in an anvil by adding gold ingots, with each ingot restoring 25% of the pickaxe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two golden pickaxes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the pickaxe's enchantments.

## Usage
Main article: Pickaxe § Usage
### Mining
A golden pickaxe is used to break stone and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a golden pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as torches and flowers.

### Weapon
#### Java Edition
All pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take about 0.83 seconds to recover. Golden pickaxes do 2 damage per attack, or 2.4 damage per second, the same as a wooden pickaxe.

#### Bedrock Edition
All pickaxes attack instantly, with golden pickaxes doing 3 damage per attack, the same as a wooden pickaxe.

### Enchantments
A golden pickaxe can receive the following enchantments:
