### Floatation
The animation of an oak boat when atop a bubble column.
A boat floats atop still or flowing water. In Java Edition, a boat sinks if it enters a waterfall.[4] In Bedrock Edition, a boat does not sink when submerged but floats up. This feature lets a player contrive stepped uphill water flows to propel a boat uphill using only flowing water.

When a boat moves over a bubble column, it begins to shake. If the bubbles are caused by a magma block, all passengers are expelled and the boat sinks.

In Java Edition, a sunken boat cannot be re-floated until a bubble column pushes it up or it is broken by the player. In Bedrock Edition, a boat resumes floating when it emerges from the currents keeping it down, or when the bubble column is blocked or removed.

Dolphins chase players riding a boat in motion, occasionally bumping the boat, causing it to shake briefly.

### Destruction
As boats are entities, they have health. Boats effectively have just over 4 (exactly 4 damage is not enough to destroy a boat), and regenerate 1⁄10 per game tick. Critical hits are not applied to boats although the particles suggest otherwise.

Boats can be destroyed by explosions, fire and lava (but not magma blocks), cactus, and by being punched/shot by mobs, such as drowned. Boats made invulnerable with commands cannot be broken by any of these, but they still cannot be used to travel on lava because they sink.

When a boat is destroyed under normal conditions, it drops itself in item form. In certain conditions, such as when falling for exactly 12, 13, 49, 51, 111, 114, 198, 202, 310, or 315 blocks,[5] it drops two sticks and three planks upon being destroyed.

### Passengers
Multiple mobs in 2 types of boats.
Boats can support two riders, including mobs. Except for endermen in Bedrock Edition, a mob cannot exit a boat and is trapped until the boat gets destroyed, or until the player uses a fishing rod or lead to remove the mob. This can be used to transport mobs, although hostile mobs still attack while in boats. Mobs riding a boat don't despawn‌[Java Edition  only] and don't count toward the mob cap.[6]

A player cannot both move (row) and use items at the same time. It is still possible to initialize item use (e.g. start eating) and row the boat while the item is still in the middle of the use animation. Although the rowing animation overrides the item use animation, the item can still be successfully consumed. This does not work with items that are triggered by the release of the use button (such as bows and tridents).‌[Java Edition  only]

Being in a boat limits the player's mouse-look to the forward 210° arc in Java Edition and 180° in Bedrock Edition.

Underwater boats cannot be ridden. When the boat is underwater, all passengers in it are expelled.

### Damage prevention
Riding a boat does not deplete hunger, making it an efficient way to travel.

Boats can completely nullify fall damage for themselves and any players/mobs inside, making them useful for travel through mountains or through the Nether.[7][8] However in Java Edition, due to a bug, boats can break when falling from certain heights, and the riders take fall damage.[5]

### Collision
A boat has a solid collision box, which means players and other entities can't go through it even with high speed. Falling blocks are also blocked by boats.

In Java Edition, a boat falling on top of an entity stops on top of the entity. In Bedrock Edition, a falling boat can go through other entities.

Riding a boat over a lily pad causes the lily pad to drop, although the boat's speed stutters a bit.

### Mobs
Most mobs can ride boats. Mobs cannot exit the boat unless the boat is destroyed, sinks, or moves over a bubble column. However, in Bedrock Edition, endermen can teleport out of boats.

Mobs can be picked up into the boat when they collide with the side of the boat. A mob cannot control the boat. In Java Edition, a boat being ridden by a player cannot pick up a mob. In Bedrock Edition, mobs can be picked up by a boat being ridden by a player. In Minecraft Education, even tripod cameras can ride boats.

A mob can ride a boat if it is narrower than a boat, and is neither an aquatic[9] nor ambient animal. The following mobs are unable to ride in a boat:

- Agent
- Bat
- Cod
- Dolphin
- Elder guardian
- Ender dragon
- Ghast
- Giant
- Glow squid
- Iron golem
- NPC
- Pufferfish
- Ravager
- Salmon
- Spider
- Squid
- Tadpole
- Tropical fish
- Warden[10]
- Wither[10]

The baby counterparts of these mobs are able to ride in boats, but not the adult versions:

- Camel
- Donkey
- Hoglin
- Horse
- Mule
- Polar bear
- Skeleton horse
- Sniffer
- Zoglin
- Zombie horse

Additionally, few types of mobs can have various Size values, which can prevent them from riding boats:

- Slimeabove size 1
- Magma cubeabove size 1
- Phantomabove size 3
