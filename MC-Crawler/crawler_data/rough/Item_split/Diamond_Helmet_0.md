A diamond helmet can be repaired in an anvil by adding diamonds, with each diamond restoring 25% the helmet's maximum durability, rounded down. Two diamond helmets can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the helmet's enchantments.

1. ↑ a bEnchantment probabilities are the same as a level-20 to level-39 enchantment would be on an enchantment table that had no cap at level 30, and that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.
2. ↑ a bAll enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.
3. ↑ a bThe item has between 80% and 100% of its total durability.

### Mob loot
Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, bogged, piglins, and zombified piglins have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the helmet they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.

### Trading
In Java Edition, master-level armorer villagers always sell an enchanted diamond helmet for 11-27 emeralds.

In Bedrock Edition, master-level armorer villagers have a 50% chance to sell enchanted diamond helmet for 8 emeralds.

## Usage
Helmets can be placed in the top armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.
