## Behavior
The allay's luminous texture allows it to be seen clearly in the dark, although it doesn't illuminate its surroundings.

The allay is small, peaceful and flies aimlessly until a player gives it an item with their use key. The allay starts following the player and seeks out dropped versions of the same item to deliver them to its player. The allay returns to wandering around if any player takes its item back by using an empty hand on it.

The allay locks onto the player that last gave it an item. This allay follows the player from up to a 64-block cubic area away and seeks items up to a 32-block cubic area away from the player. After delivering items, the allay has a delay of three seconds until it can seek items again. An allay has a single inventory slot to hold a stack of items (usually 64 items) in addition to the item it got from the player. While the allay does not discern enchantments, special item names or items in shulker boxes when it seeks, it still carries such items in separate trips.

Allays don't pick up any items if the game rule /gamerule mobGriefing is set to false, but the player can still give the allay items with the use key. 

If the allay hears a note block play within 16 blocks of its location while delivering items, it instead delivers its items to the note block and then spend 30 seconds around that particular note block, seeking items around it and returning them to it instead of its player. The allay returns to targeting its player after 30 seconds. A vibration particle emanates from the note block and reaches the allay to indicate the allay has locked on to the note block. While an allay is focused on a note block, it responds only to sound from that note block, which resets the time until the allay loses interest. This in principle allows allays to focus on a single note block while other note blocks are playing in the vicinity, thus allowing many allays to work in parallel with different note blocks. Because the allay and the note block interact via a vibration particle, placing wool between the note block and the allay can prevent this sound interaction. 

The allay can pick up items within a radius of about 1.3 blocks from itself and drop items up to 3 blocks away from its player or note block.

An allay performs a dance animation when there is a nearby jukebox playing. If the jukebox stops playing or if the allay gets too far away from the jukebox, it stops dancing.

The allay cannot enter water, although it attempts to gather items that are under water. 

Allays cannot be harmed by their interacted owners. If they are harmed by another source, they fly away for a few seconds. When killed, allays drop the items they were holding. If an allay dies while holding a totem of undying, it instead returns to full health and the totem is destroyed, as with any mob holding a totem of undying. Allays naturally regenerate 2 per second if damaged.

Using a lead or a named name tag performs the item's normal function, instead of giving it to the allay. An allay may be given a lead by first leashing the allay to a fence post.
