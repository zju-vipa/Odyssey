# The Moon
The Moon is a joke dimension that can be accessed by flying up to Y=700 in the Overworld.

The Moon has a weak gravitational pull. So weak, in fact, that at certain heights the player is pulled back to Earth, "falling up", so to say. The player's oxygen also decreases on the Moon, though much slower than in water. Cheese, which makes up almost the entirety of the Moon, restores both hunger and oxygen, allowing the player to survive here.

## Accessing
The Moon can be accessed by flying up to Y=700 in the Overworld. Conversely, flying up to Y=700 on the Moon brings the player back to the Overworld.

## Traits
Upon arriving on the Moon, player is spawned at Y=600, falling toward the Moon's surface. A player who jumps on the Moon while being above Y=117 gets pulled back up toward Earth, although this can be counteracted with either elytra or Creative mode flight. Strength of the gravitational pull varies with height; while standing on Y=117, player is able to jump about 9 blocks up, and while standing on Y=1, jump height decreases to only 3 blocks.

The Moon is composed almost entirely out of cheese, a reference to the misconception/joke that the Moon is made out of cheese. Surface is covered with craters, varying in size, and ravines. Highest naturally generated cheese layer occurs at Y=60. On the bottom of the Moon there are 5 layers of bedrock, generating in the same way as in the Overworld and Nether. There are no caves on the Moon. Only one structure generates, the lunar base.

There is no weather, but daylight cycle occurs, with Earth visible in the sky instead of the Moon. Sky does not change its color regardless of the position of the Sun, due to Moon having no atmosphere. Players slowly suffocate (it takes full 5 minutes to use up all oxygen), similarly to being underwater with a high level of Respiration, although this is a distinct type of suffocation. Neither Respiration nor Water Breathing can prevent it. If the player runs out of oxygen and dies on the Moon, death message says "<player> experienced the dark side of the moon".

Both beds and respawn anchors explode if player tries to set their spawnpoint, just like in the End.

## Biomes
The Moon has only one biome, bearing the same name.
