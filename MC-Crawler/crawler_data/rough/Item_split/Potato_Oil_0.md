## Obtaining
### Refinement
Refining a potato in a potato refinery with a glass bottle in the bottle slot outputs 1 potato oil. This takes 125 game ticks (6.25 seconds) and grants 0.1.



## Usage
To drink potato oil, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Drinking it gives the player It's very slippery for 1 tick and returns an empty bottle.

### Lubrication
Potato oil can be used to lubricate any item in a potato refinery by placing the potato oil into the first item slot and the item to lubricate into the second item slot.



## Lubricated items
When an item is lubricated using potato oil, it gains the lubrication component with a level of 1. This causes the item to slide around when dropped, as though it was on ice.
