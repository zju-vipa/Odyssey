# Bee
Bees are flying neutral mobs that live in bee nests and beehives. Bees pollinate flowers and, when they do, add honey to their home when they return to it. When full, bee nests or beehives can be harvested with shears for honeycombs or glass bottles for honey bottles. If provoked by being attacked or breaking or harvesting their hive or nest without the correct precautions, bees suicidally attack in a swarm.

## Spawning
### Natural generation
Naturally generated bee nests generate with 3 bees in them.

Naturally-generated birch or oak trees have equal chances to generate with a bee nest, depending on the biome:

| Biome                                               | Chance |        |  |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--|
|                                                     | JE     | BE     |  |
| Meadow                                              |        | 100%   |  |
| Plains<br/>Sunflower plains                         |        | 5%     |  |
| Mangrove Swamp                                      | 5%     | 4%     |  |
| Flower forest                                       | 2%     | 3%     |  |
| Forest<br/>Birch forest<br/>Old growth birch forest | 0.2%   | 0.035% |  |
| Cherry Grove                                        | 5%     | ?%     |  |

### Saplings
Oak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of any flower have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest having 1–3 bees in it.

## Drops
### On death
Upon death, adult bees drop 1–3 orbs when killed by a player or a tamed wolf. Like other baby animals, killing a baby bee yields no experience.

### Breeding
Upon breeding with any flower successfully, 1–7 is dropped.

## Behavior
Bees do not fly (like ghasts or the ender dragon), but instead hover a few blocks above the ground similar to bats and parrots.

Bees are considered arthropods and take increased damage from the Bane of Arthropods enchantment.[1] In Java Edition, they take damage when touching water.[2]

Bees can be attached to a lead, even when angered. They can still attack while attached.

Bees usually venture up to 22 blocks from their beehive to find something they can pollinate or to attack someone. Bees can venture further away if necessary.

A bee can fly horizontally and vertically upward through scaffolding but does not fly downward. A bee does not fly through an open trap door or regular door on its own (a bee can be led through a door with a flower) but babies can fly through the gap above a fence gate in a 1×2 doorway.

Despite being flying mobs, bees can destroy turtle eggs when on top of them.[3]

### Pollinating
Bees leave their nest one by one during the day. They fly around their nests, and are attracted to flowers, flowering azaleas, flowering azalea leaves, mangrove propagules, pink petals, cherry leaves, spore blossoms and chorus flowers. Bees can pollinate wither roses and die as a result, as wither roses are harmful to them.[4] Bees completely ignore flowers in flower pots.[5][6]

After circling a flower for more than 400 ticks while making happy buzzing sounds, a bee collects pollen. However, if the bee gets damaged, it ceases its pollination efforts. A bee carrying pollen changes its texture to include pollen spots on its abdomen, and drops pollen particles to fertilize plants below the bee. 

Bees that have pollen may pollinate wheat crops, potato crops, carrot crops, beetroot crops, melon stems, sweet berry bushes, pumpkin stems, cave vines, torchflower crops and pitcher pods they fly over. When one of these plants gets pollinated, it advances to another growth stage, similar to using bone meal. To pollinate a plant, bee must be 1 to 2 blocks directly above the plant and must have a valid home hive. A bee can fertilize plants 10 times each time they have pollen, and whether fertilization is attempted each tick is random (approximately a 1% chance).

Afterward, the bee flies back into its hive/nest and makes honey. It takes about 2 minutes for the bee to do this. That increases the amount of honey in a hive/nest by 1; there is a 1% chance for it to increase by 2. When the amount reaches 5, honey can be seen dripping from the bottom and front of the hive/nest. A hive/nest must have 5 honey inside before a player can collect honeycombs or honey bottles.

### Housing

Bees live together in colonies and take any bee nest or beehive that has enough space as its home. One bee nest/beehive can house up to 3 bees. Homeless bees search for empty beehives by wandering around generally in a northwest direction. Bees can enter a beehive from any side, but exit only from the front. One-way bee-gates can be made in this way.

Bees return to their nest when it rains or when it is night. They return even when in biomes that don't rain like desert. They stay in their nest or hive for at least 2400 game ticks (2 minutes) before coming back out. The bees that come out keep their data (health, name, etc.). 

Breaking a nest or hive without Silk Touch releases all bees contained inside. If the nest or hive is harvested using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, the bees are contained in the dropped item and can exit the nest/hive when it is placed again.

When a bee that has pollen enters and then leaves its nest or hive, the honey level of the nest/hive is increased by one; there is a 1% chance it is increased by two. When the honey level of that hive reaches 5, the player can harvest it, which then sets it back to 0.

Because there is neither daylight cycle nor weather in the Nether and the End, bees work without resting in these dimensions. This behavior is distinct from that of the villagers, which follow their daily routine according to the time in the Overworld, regardless of which dimension they are in.
