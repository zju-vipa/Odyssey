## Obtaining
### Crafting
| Ingredients                                | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Red Mushroom+<br/>Brown Mushroom+<br/>Bowl |                 |

### Harvesting
Mushroom stew can be obtained by “milking” a mooshroom with an empty bowl. This is accomplished by using a bowl on a mooshroom. The bowl gets replaced by the mushroom stew item. There is no cooldown for doing so.

If a stack of more than one bowl is used on a mooshroom, only one bowl is consumed, and the mushroom stew goes into an empty inventory slot, or is dropped if the player's inventory is full.

## Usage
### Food
See also: Hunger management

To eat mushroom stew, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 6 () hunger and 7.2 hunger 
saturation.

The bowl is returned to the player empty after the mushroom stew has been eaten, and can be reused to craft more, similarly to rabbit stew and beetroot soup.
