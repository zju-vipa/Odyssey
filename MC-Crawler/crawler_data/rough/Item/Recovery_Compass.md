## Obtaining
### Crafting
| Ingredients             | Crafting recipe |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Echo Shard+<br/>Compass |                 |

## Usage
When held by a player, the recovery compass point toward the spot where the player previously died.

The recovery compass works only when it is held by a player who has previously died and is in the same dimension as their last death. Otherwise, it spins around randomly.

Like other items, the recovery compass itself still drops when a player dies and the keepInventory game rule is not enabled.

This item is useless on Hardcore mode, because once the player dies, the player cannot respawn.
