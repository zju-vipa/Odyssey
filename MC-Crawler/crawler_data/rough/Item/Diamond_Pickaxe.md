A diamond pickaxe can be repaired in an anvil by adding diamonds, with each diamond restoring 25% of the pickaxe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two diamond pickaxes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the pickaxe's enchantments.

### Trading

The enchantments are the same as the ones obtained from an enchantment table at levels 5–19.

## Usage
Main article: Pickaxe § Usage
### Mining
A diamond pickaxe is used to break stone and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a diamond pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as torches and flowers.

A diamond pickaxe or better is required to mine the following blocks:

- Obsidian
- Crying Obsidian
- Respawn Anchor
- Ancient Debris
- Block of Netherite

### Weapon
#### Java Edition
All pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take about 0.83 seconds to recover. Diamond pickaxes do 5 damage per attack, or 6 damage per second.

#### Bedrock Edition
All pickaxes attack instantly, with diamond pickaxes doing 6 damage per attack.

### Enchantments
A diamond pickaxe can receive the following enchantments:

| Name               | Description                                             | Max level | Method                     | Weight |

| Curse of Vanishing | The pickaxe vanishes on death, not dropping as an item. | I         | Anvil                      | 1      |

1. ↑ a bSilk Touch and Fortune are mutually exclusive

### Upgrading
Like other diamond tools, a diamond pickaxe can be upgraded to a netherite pickaxe, increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item. The upgraded pickaxe will keep its enchantments, name and other item data.
