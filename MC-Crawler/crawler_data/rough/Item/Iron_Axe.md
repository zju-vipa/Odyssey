#### Unit repair
Main article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair
Repair & NameDamaged Iron Axe
An iron axe can be repaired in an anvil by adding iron ingot, with each ingot restoring 25% of the axe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two iron axes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the axe's enchantments.

### Mob loot
#### Equipment
Main article: Drops § Equipped items
A vindicator spawns with an iron axe and has an 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II, and 11.5% with Looting III) of dropping it upon death by the player. It is usually heavily damaged and is sometimes enchanted.

#### Raids
In Bedrock Edition, Vindicator and pillagers that spawn in raids have a 4.1% chance (5.12% on hard) to drop a badly-damaged iron axe, which is sometimes enchanted with a random enchantment. A vindicator can drop 2 iron axes, one from natural equipment and one from raid drops.

### Trading
Journeyman-level Toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell an enchanted iron axe for eight emeralds.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

Journeyman-level Toolsmith villagers have a 40% chance to sell an enchanted iron axe for 7-22 emeralds.‌[Java Edition  only]

Novice-level Weaponsmith villagers sell an iron axe for 3 emeralds as one of their trades.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

Novice-level Weaponsmith villagers have a 66.67% chance to sell an iron axe for 3 emeralds.‌[Java Edition  only]

The enchantments are the same as the ones obtained from an enchantment table at levels 5–19.

### Villager gifts
Weaponsmith villagers occasionally throw iron axes at players with the Hero of the Village status effect.‌[Java Edition  only]

## Usage
### Breaking
Iron axes can break wood-related blocks faster than other tools. Breaking a block costs 1 durability.[note 1]

1. ↑Blocks that break instantly don't use up durability.

### Stripping
Using an iron axe on a log, wood block, or block of bamboo turns it into a stripped log, stripped wood, or block of stripped bamboo, respectively. This costs 1 point of durability of the axe.

#### Copper blocks
Using an iron axe on a waxed or oxidized copper block removes the wax if it has any, or otherwise remove a level of oxidization. This costs 1 point of durability.

### Weapon
When used as a weapon, an iron axe loses 2 durability points.

#### Java Edition
Attacking a shield user with an axe disables the use of the shield for 5 seconds. Vindicators, piglin brutes, or other mobs with commands always disable the player's shield. Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a sword of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to recover, resulting in lower DPS.

| Attack Damage | Attack Speed | Recovery time                 | DPS | Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------------------|-----|-----------------------------------|
| 9             | 0.9          | 1.11 seconds (22.2game ticks) | 8.1 | 1125× 562.5                       |

1. ↑The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.

#### Bedrock Edition
Iron axes attack instantly with no cooldown and deal 5 damage, but they lower the durability of armor and shields faster than a sword would do.

### Enchantments
An iron axe can receive the following enchantments:
