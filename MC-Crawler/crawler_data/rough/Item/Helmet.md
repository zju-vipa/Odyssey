# Helmet
Helmets are a type of armor that covers the head of the player. There are six primary types of helmets: leather cap, chainmail helmet, iron helmet, diamond helmet, gold helmet and netherite helmet. There are also turtle shells, which are a special type of helmet which can also be used in brewing. They are mentioned in this article only for comparison of various metrics; see its individual article for complete information about them.

A helmet can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the helmet's maximum durability, rounded down. Two helmets of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the helmet's enchantments.

### Natural generation
Two armor stands are found in each taiga village outdoor armory, one of them equipped with an iron helmet.

1. ↑ a b c d e fAll enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.
2. ↑ a b c dEnchantment probabilities are the same as a level-20 to level-39 enchantment would be on an enchantment table that had no cap at level 30, and that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.
3. ↑ a bThe item has between 80% and 100% of its total durability.

### Mob loot
Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, bogged, piglins, and zombified piglins have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the helmet they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.

In Bedrock Edition, vindicators and pillagers spawned in raids have a 4.16% chance (5.128% on hard difficulty) to drop an iron helmet. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and has a 50% chance of being enchanted with a random enchantment.

### Trading
In Java Edition, novice-level armorer villagers have a 40% chance to sell an iron helmet for 4 emeralds. Journeyman-level armorers have a 40% chance to sell a chainmail helmet for 1 emerald. Master-level armorers always sell an enchanted diamond helmet for 11-27 emeralds. Apprentice-level leatherworker villagers have a 2⁄3 chance to sell a leather cap[note 1] for 5 emeralds. Master-level leatherworker villagers offer the same trade.

Armorer villagers may give the players with the Hero of the Village effect a chainmail helmet.

In Bedrock Edition, novice-level armorer villagers have a 25% chance to sell iron helmet for 5 emeralds, 1⁄3 chance to sell chainmail helmet at journeyman-level for an emerald, and 50% chance to sell enchanted diamond helmet for 8 emeralds at master-level. Apprentice-level leatherworker villagers have a 50% chance to sell leather cap for 5 emeralds as part of their trades, and 50% chance to sell an enchanted leather cap for 5 emeralds at the master level.


↑ The leather armor has a random color created by two dyes (possibly the same dye twice.)


## Usage
Helmets can be placed in the top armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.

### Defense points
Defense points are each signified by half of a shirt of mail in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

The following table shows the number of defense points added by helmets.

| Material     |      |
|--------------|------|
| Leather      | 1 () |
| Golden       | 2 () |
| Chainmail    |      |
| Iron         |      |
| Turtle Shell |      |
| Diamond      | 3 () |
| Netherite    |      |

### Knockback resistance
A netherite helmet provides 10% knockback resistance.

### Durability
The following table shows the amount of damage each piece of armor can absorb before being destroyed.

Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits helmets can endure.

Netherite armor is not damaged by lava or fire when worn.

| Material     | Durability |
|--------------|------------|
| Leather      | 55         |
| Golden       | 77         |
| Chainmail    | 165        |
| Iron         |            |
| Turtle Shell | 275        |
| Diamond      | 363        |
| Netherite    | 407        |

#### Repair
Helmets may be repaired by using them along with some of their crafting material (leather, gold ingots, iron ingots, diamonds or netherite) in an anvil. Chainmail helmets may be repaired in this way with iron ingots. They may also be repaired by crafting them together with another helmet of like material.

### Enchantments
A helmet can receive the following enchantments. Note that while iron and chainmail have the same durability, chainmail has a higher enchantability than iron or diamond.

### Armor trimming
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a helmet, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, or diamond).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

### Piglins
Piglins are attracted to golden helmets and pick them up, examining them for 6 to 8 seconds. Piglins can wear other helmets but are not attracted to them. They prefer stronger helmets over weaker helmets, with one exception: They always prefer golden helmets, throwing out stronger helmets in favor of gold helmets. Enchanted helmets are preferred over unenchanted helmets.

- tag: Parent tag.
	- display: Display properties.
		- color: The color of the leather armor. The tooltip displays "Dyed" if advanced tooltips are disabled, otherwise it displays the hexadecimal color value. Color codes are calculated from the Red, Green and Blue components using this formula:Red<<16 + Green<<8 + Blue[1]
