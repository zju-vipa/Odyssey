### Natural generation
Copper horns were found in pillager outpost chests.

## Usage
Copper horns were used to play sounds. They took one second to use and had a four second cooldown. There were ten variations of copper horns, and each of them played three different sounds: when looking up, crouching, or neither of those. In total, there were thirty different sounds that could be played using copper horns. The sound a copper horn played was based on multiple conditions, which are in order as follows:

- If crouching, the bass tune was played.
- Else, if looking up (by 45 degrees), the harmony tune was played.
- Else, the melody tune was played.
