## Generation

Large Biomes worlds generates overworld biomes with much more expansive and larger climate zones compared to default worlds at approximately 4 times the scale. Even with using the same seed, the climate zones do not match that of default worlds due to multi-noise parameters used to generate worlds since 1.18. Large biomes does not change the size of mountains or rivers compared to default worlds. As such, there are often larger clusters of mountain biomes that generate within each biome.

The player can use a map to gain a visual representation of the scale of the biomes in their world.

Large Biomes offer a play experience different from regular sized worlds. If a player starts in an undesirable area, such as a desert, it can be difficult to survive. The generation system also leads to rare biomes being far more difficult to come by, but with more valuable resources when they are eventually found.
