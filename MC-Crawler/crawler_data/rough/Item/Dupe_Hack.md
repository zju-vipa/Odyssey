## Obtaining
Once the dupe_hack_occurrence_chance vote is approved the dupe hack item has a random chance of dropping whenever an entity with chests is killed by a player, e.g. when destroying a minecart with chest with a sword.

It doesn't appear in the Creative inventory, not even when the option "Operator Items Tab" is enabled, but can be given to the player with /give and other commands.

## Usage
The dupe hack item can be used to create a limited amount of duplicate items by placing it on a crafting table with any other item. It has a random chance of breaking, controlled by the dupe_hack_break_chance vote. This limitation can be mitigated by putting the items in a shulker box first and then duplicating the box.
