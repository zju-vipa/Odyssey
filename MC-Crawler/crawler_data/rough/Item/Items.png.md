## Format
items.png is a fixed-width 256×256-pixel file that is split into different 16×16 squares which correspond to the texture of each item found in-game. Like with particles.png, unused sections of the texture are completely transparent, unlike with terrain.png and the paintings sheet where such regions are colored magenta.

## Usage
Before the introduction of texture packs, items.png was used as the texture file for all items in the game. To change any item textures in-game, it had to be edited and placed inside an edited minecraft.jar file.

items.png was in use by Java Edition until 13w02b, Pocket Edition Alpha until version v0.7.0 alpha and actively by Legacy Console Edition.
