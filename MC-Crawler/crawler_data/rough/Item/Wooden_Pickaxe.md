A wooden pickaxe can be repaired in an anvil by adding wooden planks, with each plank restoring 25% of the pickaxe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two wooden pickaxes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the pickaxe's enchantments.

## Usage
Main article: Pickaxe § Usage
### Mining
A wooden pickaxe is used to break stone-based and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a wooden pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as torches and flowers.

### Weapon
#### Java Edition
All pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take about 0.83 seconds to recover. Wooden pickaxes do 2 damage per attack, or 2.4 damage per second.

#### Bedrock Edition
All pickaxes attack instantly, with wooden pickaxes doing 3 damage per attack.

### Enchantments
A wooden pickaxe can receive the following enchantments:
