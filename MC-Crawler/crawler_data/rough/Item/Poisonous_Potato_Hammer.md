## Usage
Poisonous potato hammer has an attack damage of 11, one more than an unenchanted netherite axe, and an attack speed of 6, allowing the player to hit nearly four times faster than with a sword. This allows it to strike faster than the immunity period of a single target, during which the target can't receive consecutive damage. Hammer comes enchanted with Knockback X and, unlike other weapons, doesn't lose durability when used. The Knocback enchantment can be removed via a grindstone, but no other enchantment can be applied to the hammer in Survival mode, either through an enchanting table or an anvil.

When used to damage a mob, it has a 30% chance of throwing a lingering potion of Poison at the mob.

### Creative mode
Players in Creative mode holding the poisonous potato hammer are unable to break blocks, just like with a sword.
