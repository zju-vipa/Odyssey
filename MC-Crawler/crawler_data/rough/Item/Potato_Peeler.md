## Usage
### Attacking
It can be used to damage potato mobs for 12 × 6. When attacking other mobs, it deals only 2 damage. Potato peeler has a very fast attack speed of 5 and only takes 0.2 seconds to recover.

### Enchantments
Despite having similar functionality to a sword, potato peeler can't receive any enchantments in Survival mode, whether through an enchanting table or an anvil.

### Peeling
When potato mobs are killed by the peeler, they can drop potato peels, depending on the mob type. Peeler can also be used on potato sheep to drop the peels corresponding to sheep's wool color.

using the peeler on peelgrass block or corrupted peelgrass block converts it to terre de pomme and drops lime potato peels or corrupted potato peels, respectively. Peeler can also be used on blocks of potato peels, which destroys the block and drops 9 peels of the corresponding type.

### Creative mode
Players in Creative mode holding the potato peeler are unable to break blocks, just like with a sword.
