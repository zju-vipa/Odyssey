# Cooked Food
Cooked items are foodstuffs which give more food points than their raw variants. They can be obtained through methods such as cooking them in a furnace or on a campfire, trading or killing mobs with fire. 

Cooking food increases the amount of food points from it when consumed and removes the risk of getting hunger from raw chicken.
