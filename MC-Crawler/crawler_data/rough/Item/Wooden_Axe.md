#### Unit repair
Main article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair
Repair & NameDamaged Wooden Axe
A wooden axe can be repaired in an anvil by adding wooden planks, with each plank restoring 25% of the axe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two wooden axes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the axe's enchantments.

### Chest loot
The player usually finds a wooden axe in a bonus chest, if it is turned on.

## Usage
### Chopping
Wooden axes can break wood-related blocks faster than other tools. Breaking a block costs 1 durability.[note 1]

1. ↑Blocks that break instantly don't use up durability.

### Stripping
Using a wooden axe on a log, wood block, bamboo block turns it into a stripped log, stripped wood, or stripped bamboo, respectively. This uses 1 point of durability of the axe.

#### Copper blocks
Using a wooden axe on a waxed or somewhat oxidized Copper block removes the wax if it has any, or otherwise remove a level of oxidization. This costs 1 point of durability.

### Weapon
When used as a weapon, a wooden axe loses 2 durability points.

#### 
Wooden axe always disables a shield, although there should be a chance of it happening.[1] Damage done by a wooden axe is equivalent to that of a diamond sword, but it has a longer cooldown.

#### Bedrock Edition
Wooden axes attack instantly with no cooldown and do 1 less damage than a wooden sword, but it lowers the durability of armor and shields faster than a sword would do.

### Enchantments
A wooden axe can receive the following enchantments:
