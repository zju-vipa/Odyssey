### Beacons
Blocks of amber can be used to "power" a beacon. The beacon can be powered by a 3×3 square of amber blocks underneath it, and can optionally also include a 5×5, 7×7 and 9×9 layer in the shape of a pyramid under the original layer to increase the effects from the beacon. The layers do not have to be entirely blocks of amber, as they may also contain blocks of iron,  blocks of gold, blocks of diamond, blocks of netherite or blocks of emerald.

### Note blocks
Blocks of amber can be placed under note blocks to produce "bit" sounds.
