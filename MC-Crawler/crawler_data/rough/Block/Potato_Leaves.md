## Obtaining
### Breaking
Potato leaves can be obtained only with shears or Silk Touch enchanted tools. Unlike other leaves, potato leaves aren't mined any faster with a hoe, but a sword does break the block faster.

| Block    | Leaves              |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0.2                 |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.3                 |
| Shears   | 0.05                |
| Sword    | 0.2                 |

### Natural generation
Potato leaves generate in the Potato dimension on potato trees, which grow in arboretum and corruption biomes. They also generate as part of potato villages, creating hedge mazes.

## Usage
For the mechanics of all leaves, see Leaves § Usage.

Unlike other leaves, potato leaves are not flammable.
