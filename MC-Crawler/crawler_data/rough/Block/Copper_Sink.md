## Usage
Copper sinks can be filled with water. They are implemented rather simply: a water bucket can be emptied in a sink after which it becomes filled, interacting with a filled sink using an empty bucket fills the bucket. Bottles cannot interact with the copper sink, nor can buckets with other liquids.

Dropping any exclusively copper-based items into the sink deletes them, including Raw Copper, Copper Ingot, Block of Copper, and other copper sinks.
