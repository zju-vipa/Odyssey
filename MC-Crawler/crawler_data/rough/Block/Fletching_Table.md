## Usage
The fletching table currently has no right-click functionality; though, if right-clicked in Spectator mode, it shows the crafting table interface for a split second.[1] Its functionality may be added in upcoming updates.[2]

### Placement
Regardless of the player's position while placement, the different textures of the block are always facing in the same position (the textures with the target are facing west and east, while the one with the knife and feather is facing up).

### Changing profession
If a village has a fletching table that has not been claimed by a villager, any villager who hasn't already picked a job site block has a chance to change their profession to fletcher.

### Fuel
Fletching tables can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.

### Note Blocks
Fletching tables can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.
