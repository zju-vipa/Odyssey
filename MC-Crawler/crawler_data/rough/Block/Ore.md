## Usage

  

This section needs cleanup to comply with the style guide. [discuss]
Please help improve this page. The talk page may contain suggestions.Reason: formatting ninja needed -- three ore distribution graph images need to be moved to respective sections of the Distribution section while playing nice with the tables there.

Ore distribution 1.18-1.20.2
Ore blocks are primarily collected for their resources, which are used for crafting items, such as tools, weapons, armor, and redstone circuits. The resource can also be combined to create a block of the material's type. 

Most ores drop their resource when mined, and require a Silk Touch pickaxe to drop themselves.

- Coal,diamond,emerald, their respectivedeepslatevariants, andnether quartzores drop 1 unit of their corresponding material.
- Iron,gold, and their respective deepslate variant ores drop 1 unit of their raw form.
- Copperand deepslate copper ores drop 2–5 raw copper.
- Redstoneand deepslate redstone ores drop 4–5redstone dust.
- Lapis lazuliand deepslate lapis lazuli ores drop 4–9lapis lazuli.
- Nether gold oresdrop 2–6gold nuggets.

Average yield of any of the above can be increased by using a pickaxe with Fortune.

- Ancient debrisis the exception; it drops itself when mined and must be smelted to obtainnetherite scrap.

### Smelting ingredient
| Ingredients                                           | Smelting recipe                           |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Any ore + Anyfuel                                     | 0.10.10.70.70.70.70.20.2110.70.711110.212 |
| Raw Ironor<br/>Raw Copperor<br/>Raw Gold+<br/>Anyfuel | 0.70.71                                   |

Ores can be smelted faster using a blast furnace.

It is not efficient to mine with Silk Touch and then smelt an ore block that normally drops multiple pieces of its resource, because smelting these ores yields less experience and only 1 piece of the resource. Nether gold ore is the only exception, as each ore block drops an average of 8.8 gold nuggets even when mined with Fortune III, which is less than a guaranteed gold ingot obtained from smelting the ore obtained using Silk Touch.

### Note blocks
All types of ores can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass drum" sounds.

## Distribution
Main article: Ore (feature)
The following is the distribution of ores according to the altitude (layers are number of blocks above the lowest layer of bedrock) in the Overworld and the Nether. For detailed generation, see Ore (feature).

### Overworld
For the pre-1.17 ore distribution, see Ore/Pre-1.17 distribution.

For the 1.17 ore distribution, see Ore/Pre-1.18 distribution.

1. ↑This refers to coal ore blocks spawned in blobs and not as parts of fossils or mansion forges.
2. ↑Instead of multi-block blobs, emerald ore is placed in scattered blocks.
3. ↑Deepslate variants only generate in the deepslate under layer 0.
4. ↑Copper ore blobs generate in larger sizes in this biome.
5. ↑Gold ore has increased frequency in this biome.
6. ↑ a bThis is based on data acquired from real world generation. Maximum values in world generation data files are different because in actual generation, terrain and features might prevent ores from spawning.
7. ↑Unlike most other ores, ancient debris' frequency peaks at layer 16, and quickly tapers off above and below.
