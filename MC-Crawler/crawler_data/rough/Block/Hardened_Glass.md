## Obtaining
### Breaking
Unlike normal glass, hardened glass drops itself when broken with any tool or by hand. It also takes significantly longer to break.

## Usage
Most blocks that require placement on a solid block can be placed on hardened glass. Torches and redstone torches, which can be placed on top of the hardened glass blocks, attaching to their sides is also proven possible.

Hardened glass blocks adjacent to other hardened glass blocks are invisible when viewed through the glass, but not when viewed through normal glass.
