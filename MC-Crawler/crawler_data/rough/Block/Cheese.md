## Obtaining
### Breaking
Cheese drops itself if it has not been bitten. Once the cheese is bitten, it cannot be recollected even with the use of Silk Touch.

| Block    | Cheese              |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0.1                 |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.15                |

### Mob loot
Upon death, moon cows drop 0-2 cheese. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5 cheese blocks with Looting III.

### Milk bucket
If the minecraft:instacheese vote is active, using a milk bucket on the ground places cheese, similarly to powder snow. It cannot be picked up into the bucket again.

## Usage
Similar to cakes, cheese can be eaten when placed in the world. However, unlike cakes, the cheese block is divided into 8 smaller cubes. Clicking on one of them eats only the selected part, unlike cakes, where slices cannot be chosen.

Eating cheese restores not only hunger, but oxygen, too, allowing the player to survive on the Moon.
