### Natural generation
Floatatos naturally generate in clouds in the Potato dimension; these generate in any biome, around Y-level 110, hovering over the void. Potato clouds never generate underground and they very rarely touch terrain. A potato cloud has on average around 60 floatato blocks.

## Usage
### Placing
Feature unique to floatatoes is that they can be placed 2 blocks away from the player midair, without looking at another block.

### Crafting ingredient

### Note blocks
Floatatoes can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.
