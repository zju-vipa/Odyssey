## Obtaining
### Breaking
Nether sprouts can be mined instantly with any item. The block also breaks if the block below is removed, or if water flows into its space. The block only drops if broken with shears.

| Block    | Nether Sprouts      |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.05                |
| Shears   | 0.05                |

### Natural generation
Nether sprouts generate in warped forest biomes.


### Post-generation
Applying bone meal to warped nylium creates nether sprouts on that block and surrounding nylium, along with crimson roots, warped roots, and fungi.

## Usage
All of the blocks that nether sprouts can be placed on.
Nether sprouts can be planted on the same blocks that fungi, crimson roots, and warped roots; can be placed on: nylium, soul soil, grass, podzol, mycelium, moss, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, and farmland. However, they cannot be planted in flower pots.

### Composting
Placing nether sprouts into a composter has a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
