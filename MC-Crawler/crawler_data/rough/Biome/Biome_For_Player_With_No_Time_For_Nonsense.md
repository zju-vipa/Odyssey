## Description
The biome resembles a snowy taiga, although mineral blocks and redstone components generate instead of ores. These blocks also spawn a lot more frequently[needs testing]. Unlike in normal snowy taigas, no igloos or mobs spawn here, but mineshafts, monster rooms, strongholds, caves and ravines generate normally. Biome generates exactly the same in the busy dimension as in a Buffet world. 

Due to large amounts of block entities in this biome, it will most likely cause performance issues.

## List of ores
This biome generates redstone components and mineral blocks where ores would normally generate. Like ores, these blocks generate in blobs. All of these blocks generate at every height[verify], even above sea level.
