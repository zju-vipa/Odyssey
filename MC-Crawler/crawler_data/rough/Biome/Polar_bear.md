## Spawning
Polar bears spawn above grass or ice in snowy plains, ice spikes, regular and deep frozen ocean biomes in groups of up to two at light level 7 or higher. If there is a group, the second polar bear is a cub.

They can also spawn in frozen rivers, legacy frozen oceans, snowy slopes, also sometimes at the jagged peaks, and the frozen peaks in Bedrock Edition.

## Drops
### On death
On Java Edition, one of the following is selected. On Bedrock Edition, both drops are rolled.

Killing a baby polar bear yields no items or experience.

## Behavior
A polar bear attacking.
Polar bears can exist in a passive or hostile state. The cubs are passive; adults are hostile when with cubs or provoked (unless killed in one hit‌[JE  only]).

If a cub is attacked, unless killed in one hit‌[JE  only], all adults within a 41×21×41 area become hostile toward the player or mob, regardless of difficulty, although in Peaceful difficulty their attacks do zero damage to players.

In Java Edition, attacking an adult who is within a 16×8×16 area of a cub also provokes other adults within a 21×21×21 area of the attacked adult.

Polar bears also attack foxes.

- InJava Edition, adult polar bears attack any fox that stays near it for a while, hitting it once every few seconds. Cubs are more aggressive and attack foxes within 16 blocks.
- InBedrock Edition, adult polar bears attack foxes within 16 blocks. Cubs do not attack foxes.

Polar bears attack by rearing on their back legs and mauling down with their front paws. Their swimming speed is equal to the player's, making them difficult to get away from if they are attacking in water.

Polar bears cannot breed and cubs' growth cannot be sped up.

They do not take freezing damage from powder snow.
