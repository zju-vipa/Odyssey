# Piglin
A piglin is a neutral mob found in the Nether. It is hostile to players unless they wear at least one piece of golden armor. It can be given gold ingots to barter for various items. It wields either a golden sword or a crossbow, and uses either melee or ranged attacks, respectively. 

Baby piglins do not grow up, never hold weapons or attack, and take gold without giving anything in return.

## Spawning
Piglins spawn in groups of 2-4 in nether wastes and crimson forest biomes, and within bastion remnants upon generation, at light levels of 11 in Java Edition or 7 in Bedrock Edition and below on most blocks other than nether wart blocks and magma blocks. In Bedrock Edition, they can naturally spawn on Peaceful difficulty. Each piglin has a 20%‌[Java Edition  only] or 5%‌[Bedrock Edition  only] chance to spawn as a baby.

Each adult piglin has a 50% chance to spawn with a weapon: either a sword [more information needed] or a crossbow [more information needed]. An adult piglin can also spawn with armor. Each armor slot on a piglin has 10% chance per armor slot to spawn with golden armor. Therefore, each piglin has a 34.39% chance to spawn with at least 1 piece of armor, and a 0.01% chance to spawn with a full set. Baby piglins never spawn with weapons or armor.

A baby piglin can also be spawned by using a piglin spawn egg on an adult piglin.

## Drops
### On death
| Item |             | Roll Chance | Quantity (Roll Chance) |           |            |             |
|------|-------------|-------------|------------------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
|      |             |             | Default                | Looting I | Looting II | Looting III |
|      | Piglin Head | 100%[d 1]   | 1                      | 1         | 1          | 1           |

1. ↑Only when killed by a charged creeper.

If a piglin is killed in one hit while admiring a gold ingot, the ingot drops. However, if the piglin is hit and not killed, the piglin stops admiring the item. This causes the item to vanish from its hands and subsequently not drop when the piglin is killed.

### Equipment
Adults have an 8.5% chance [more information needed] of dropping each naturally held or worn  piece of equipment. The dropped item has a random durability. Each level of Looting used to kill the piglin increases the drop chance for each piece of equipment by 1%.

Babies always spawn without equipment.

#### Weapons
A piglin naturally spawns with either of these weapons:

- Golden Sword[more information needed]
- Crossbow[more information needed]

#### Armor
Adults sometimes [more information needed] spawn with 1-4 normal or enchanted pieces of armor, which may be:

- Golden Helmet
- Golden Chestplate
- Golden Leggings
- Golden Boots

### Picked up equipment
Piglins always drop picked up equipment that they spawned with.

Piglins can pick up any type of armor of weapon, as long as the new equipment is better than the current equipment. See § Picking up items.

In Java Edition, a picked-up item always drops with the same durability as when picked up.

In Bedrock Edition, armor [more information needed] picked up by piglins can lose durability and even break (if it takes enough damage).

### Other picked up items
Piglins do not drop any gold ingots, raw porkchops, or cooked porkchops that they have picked up.

### Experience
Adults drop 5 which is not affected by armor if killed by a player or tamed wolf. Baby piglins drop 5‌[JE  only][1] or 1‌[BE  only][2].

## Behavior
Piglins snort enviously while watching players holding a gold-related item.

Like villagers, piglins can open and close wooden doors but cannot open fence gates, all trapdoors, and iron doors. They also cannot climb Ladders.

Piglins cannot swim and can drown if submerged.[3] They are not naturally immune to fire or lava.[4]

Idle piglins retreat from zombified piglins, zoglins, soul fire, soul torches, soul lanterns, and lit soul campfires. Piglins ignore soul fire items when pursuing the player, but still run from zombified piglins and zoglins. Baby piglins additionally retreat from wither skeletons and withers.

Crossbow piglins do not reload their crossbows when spawned, unlike pillagers. They reload only when provoked.

Baby piglins are passive and play with baby hoglins, running around and riding upon them. Up to 3 baby piglins may stack on top of each other while riding a baby hoglin.

Baby piglins can be given gold, but they do not give anything in return and run away. Baby piglins can also pick up and wear armor as well as hold gold tools or weapons. However, they are unable to pick up leather.

Baby piglins never grow up.[5]

Unlike many other mobs, piglins cannot be spawned holding any items in their off-hand; instead, the item in question is placed into their inventory or, if applicable, their main hand or an armor slot.[6] As a consequence, they cannot fire special ammunition from their crossbows, such as firework rockets or tipped arrows, and they cannot use a totem of undying alongside a melee weapon. If spawned with an gold ingot in their off-hand, the piglin immediately drops a random bartering good without examining the ingot.

### Aggravation
Adult piglins are neutral if the player is wearing at least one piece of golden armor. Piglins are provoked by any player who: 

- Is not wearing any piece of gold armor.
	- Short range, light aggravation
- Attacks a piglin orpiglin brute, regardless if the player kills it in one hit or not.
	- Long range, heavy aggravation to the damaged piglin, medium aggravation to other piglins
- Opens or breaks achest,trapped chest,ender chest,[7]shulker box,[8]barrel,minecart with chest, orboat with chest.
	- Opening is short range, medium aggravation
	- Breaking is mid range, medium aggravation
- Breaks ablock of gold,gold ore,gilded blackstone,nether gold ore,block of raw gold, ordeepslate gold ore.
	- Mid range, medium aggravation

#### Aggravation range
Illustration of short range aggravation of piglins. Note the spherical range, and that piglins behind walls are not aggravated due to the line of sight being blocked.
- Short range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player not wearing goldarmor, or opening a container, piglins from up to around 15 blocks centered around the player become aggravated by the player if there is a straight line of sight to the player.
- Mid range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player breaking agolden blockor a container, piglins from up to 16 blocks from the player’s feet become aggravated. No line of sight is required.
- Long range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player damaging a piglin orpiglin brute, piglins from up to 16 blocks from the damaged piglin (rather than the player) become aggravated. No line of sight is required.

#### Light aggravation
- Light aggravation occurs when a piglin has been aggravated by a player not wearing goldarmor.
- The piglin can de-aggravate when the player puts on goldarmor, distracts the piglin with gold, or the piglin loses a line of sight with the player.

#### Medium aggravation
- Medium aggravation occurs when a piglin has been aggravated by a player opening/breaking a container or breaking agolden block, or when a piglin witnesses apiglin bruteor another piglin getting damaged by a player.
- Piglins under medium aggravation can be distracted with gold.
- A piglin already under light aggravation does not re-aggravate to medium aggravation. This means that if a piglin knows a player broke agolden blocknear them after already going after them due to them not wearing goldarmor, the player can de-aggravate that piglin by putting on gold armor or losing the line of sight despite the fact that the player broke thegolden block.

#### Heavy aggravation
- Heavy aggravation occurs if a piglin is damaged.
- The piglin cannot be distracted by gold and is unable to barter while under heavy aggravation.

#### Other
- If the player is under the influence of theInvisibilityeffect, they can open containers in front of piglins without aggravating them. The player is also able to break containers or gold blocks without aggravating them while invisible.
- If the player is fully invisible (e.g. not wearing any armor) they are able to attack the piglins without them retaliating. This is not the case with any other hostile or neutral mob, because mobs attacked by an invisible player still attack the player.

Opening or breaking a hopper does not provoke the piglins.[9] Piglins do not react to the opening or breaking of other containers. Breaking a bell does not provoke them either, despite piglins admiring them as gold.[10]

### Attacking
When a piglin is attacking, it holds its dominant arm and sword in front of it, similar to a vindicator.

Adult piglins are hostile toward wither skeletons and withers. 

Adult piglins congregate within 16 blocks and attack in hordes.

When attacking with a crossbow, piglins shoot arrows every 2 seconds. In Java Edition, they walk backward (stopping if at the edge of a drop) as soon as the target is close. In Java Edition, their crossbows can break if it runs out of durability,[11] making the piglins use their fists, while in Bedrock Edition their crossbows never break.[12] Unlike mobs armed with bows, they do not strafe from left to right while shooting. Also, unlike pillagers, piglins cannot fire firework rockets or special kinds of arrows, since they cannot hold them in their off-hand if spawned so.[6] Piglins with swords and other items rush at the player.

If a group of piglins successfully defeat their target, they gather at the site of their target's demise and emit "celebration sounds". However, piglins do not have a chance of dancing unless their target was a hoglin.

When a mob attacks a piglin or piglin brute with no AI, the piglin around that no AI piglin or piglin brute do not attack the mob that attacked it.

Iron golems attack both adult and baby piglins; however, piglins do not attack iron golems without provocation.

The detection range of piglins is reduced to half of their normal range (17.5 blocks) when the player is wearing a piglin head.

#### Hunting
Piglin celebrating dance.
Piglins sometimes attack hoglins, causing other piglins and piglin brutes‌[Bedrock Edition  only] in that area to attack the targeted hoglin as well.

Adults do not immediately attack adult hoglins on sight, but a piglin has a random chance to make the decision to hunt a hoglin (this decision almost never happens if the piglin recently hunted, but other piglins can still start a hunt).[verify] Once that piglin attacks the hoglin, all other piglins and piglin brutes‌[Bedrock Edition  only] in that area become hostile to the hoglin. If outnumbered by hoglins, the piglins flee, making "retreat" sounds. After defeating a hoglin (or any other Entity), piglins have a 10% chance to do a "victory dance" by bobbing their heads and sticking out their arms like a T-pose.

The more piglins there are, the bigger chance of a hunt might happen (because a lot of piglins that saw the hoglin has a 10% chance of starting a hunt).

After a hunt, any nearby piglins pick up the porkchops or cooked porkchops the hoglin dropped but not the leather. Piglin brutes never pick up any porkchops or leather.

Piglins that spawned as part of a bastion remnant during world generation do not hunt.

Piglin brutes also join in hunts started by piglins, but do not start a hunt themselves.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

#### Being distracted
Piglins briefly stop attacking when given gold items. If the player offers a gold ingot, bartering then takes place as it normally would. They resume attacking once the barter is complete. If the player distracts them with a gold item and equips a piece of gold armor while the piglin is examining the item, then the piglin ceases hostility. They may also cease hostility if distracted enough times. If the player breaks any gold-related block or hurt/kill a piglin and then distracts the piglin up to 5 times with a piece of gold armor equipped, the piglin ceases hostility entirely.

### Bartering
Main article: Bartering
Adult piglins can trade gold ingots for certain items, when a gold ingot is dropped near them or the player uses it while looking at them. The piglin "examines" the ingot for six‌[JE  only] or eight‌[BE  only][13] seconds, then drops a random item from the chart. However, baby piglins examine the ingot and then run away without dropping an item. Piglins can also pick up items dropped by a dispenser or dropper. The pool for what piglins can barter may be modified in a data pack‌[JE  only].

Piglins can still barter while riding another mob.

### Picking up items
Piglins can pick up any items they come across, preferring gold-related items, which they actively seek out.

Each piglin has eight hidden inventory slots in which it can stack items. A piglin with a full inventory does not attempt to pick up gold-related items, except gold ingots.

#### Equipping
A piglin automatically equips any armor or weapon it can pick up, as long as the new equipment is better than its current equipment. Piglins also prefer gold over other armors.

When a piglin picks up a gold-related piece of equipment, it has to inspect the item first before equipping it. Inspecting the item takes six seconds. However, non-gold equipment, if preferrable, is equipped instantly. Piglins do not pick up any items when the /gamerule mobGriefing is set to false.

Only a piglin with a crossbow can pick up crossbows.

A piglin picks up raw porkchops and cooked porkchops from 1 block, unless it has already done so within the last 10 seconds. However, a piglin does not seek out porkchops or go out of its way to collect them.

#### Piglin loved items
Items with the piglin_loved tag are the only items that piglins want and pick up. When a piglin picks up one of these items, the player who dropped it (if it was dropped by a player) is given the advancement/achievement "O(oo)h Shiny!", unless the item was a gold nugget. Piglins aren't interested in other items, and can't be distracted by other items, even if the items are related to gold in some way.

Items that piglins love:

- Bell
- Block of gold
- Block of raw gold
- Clock
- Deepslate gold ore
- Enchanted golden apple
- Gilded blackstone
- Glistering melon slice
- Gold ingot(piglinsbartersomething else in return)
- Gold nugget
- Gold ore
- Golden apple
- Golden axe
- Golden boots(worn after being examined)
- Golden carrot
- Golden chestplate(worn after being examined)
- Golden helmet(worn after being examined)
- Golden hoe
- Golden horse armor
- Golden leggings(worn after being examined)
- Golden pickaxe
- Golden shovel
- Golden sword(equipped if piglin is using a non-gold weapon or crossbow, or does not already have one)
- Light weighted pressure plate
- Nether gold ore
- Powered rail‌[Bedrock Edition  only][14]
- Raw gold

Baby piglins attempt to pick up every item, regardless of whether they love it, and they admire gold ingots or barter any items.

Adult piglins can pick up gold nuggets, but won't inspect them for bartering. (they do not actively seek out and contemplate porkchops). When killed, a piglin drops all of its items, except for gold ingots, raw porkchops, and cooked porkchops.

#### Despawning
Piglins that spawned in a bastion remnant during world generation, and piglins that have picked up or equipped items, do not despawn naturally.

### Zombification
A piglin turning into a zombified piglin.
When in the Overworld or the End, piglins transform into zombified piglins after 15 seconds, retaining their armor, held items and their name. However, they cannot shoot a crossbow, using it instead as a melee weapon. Upon transformation, the spawned zombified piglin has the Nausea effect for 10 seconds; this is just a cosmetic effect. When a piglin transforms into a zombified piglin, it drops anything except equipped weapons and armor in its inventory; other items in its inventory disappear. In Bedrock Edition, if the game is set to Peaceful difficulty, the piglin despawns instead of transforming because hostile mobs do not exist in Peaceful difficulty. A piglin that returns to the Nether before 15 seconds remains unchanged, although the 15-second portal cooldown usually prevents them from returning during that time.

A piglin does not zombify outside the Nether if its IsImmuneToZombification tag is set to true. Piglins with their NoAI tag set to true also do not zombify.

In Java Edition, if a piglin is inspecting/admiring a gold ingot or a gold-related item and then gets zombified while inspecting, it drops the gold ingot or the gold-related item.
