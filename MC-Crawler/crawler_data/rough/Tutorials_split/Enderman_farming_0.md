# Tutorials/Enderman farming
The purpose of an enderman trap is for the easy access and killing of endermen. It is possible for the user to create such a trap that can be used by simply standing still, and looking at the endermen. This angers any you look at, luring them into the trap. Most endermen traps are best suited to the End or warped forests, as endermen spawn at a considerably higher rate there. You can still create this trap in the Overworld, but endermen spawn far less often.

## Piston trap design
The schematics of this trap are as follows:

- Level the surrounding land and dig a 3×3×3 pit in the ground.
- In the center of the pit, build a tower (at least 4 blocks high.)
- Place 1 piston on each side of the tower
- Conduct a test of the pistons.
- Rig aleverbehind a piston with one block in between (at the farthest extent of your reach) and placeredstonein a ring around the pistons.
- When the redstone, lever and pistons are correctly placed the pistons should extend and fill every space except the center and create an enclosed 2 block high space.

### Using and operating the trap
To use the trap, stand on the pillar, grab a sword and look at an enderman, causing it to rush toward the player and fall into the pit. Activate the lever to extend the pistons. Wait a few moments and deactivate the lever. The enderman should be weakened by having its head smashed and the player can kill it with one strike. An upgrade is placing pressure plates (wooden for testing, so the player can activate the trap with an item, and stone for the enderman) at the bottom of the pit and rigging redstone into an AND Gate. The lever primes the trap and the enderman touching the pressure plates activates the pistons.

### Experience gains
It is possible for the user to gain EXP from this trap, as the player hitting a mob once registers the mobs' death as a player-kill. This means that even with the pistons crushing the mobs down to half a heart, you can still give experience from the player hitting the mobs at their point of death. It is also possible to switch the levers and pressure pads with a button, these can be timed to crush the endermen, then release when they reach the health points of half a heart, readying the endermen for a one hit kill from the player.

### Description
The farm is built in the End at least 128 blocks away from any spawnable block, so the endermen can spawn there only. A platform is built for the endermen to fall onto from spawning pads built at least 43 blocks above the platform, with rings built upward to prevent endermen falling onto an area that isn't the platform. On the 43rd block up vines are placed to break the fall, so the endermen take 19.5 hearts damage, leaving them on half a heart.

The spawning pads either have pressure plates on them, connected to sticky pistons with blocks attached, or a tripwire attached to normal pistons to push the endermen off the pads, down the drop and landing on the platform with only half a heart of health left, allowing for one hit kills by punching. A good way to start punching is to create a two-high ceiling and start staring at the endermen.

A similar design uses TNT ignited by a player with a bow enchanted with Flame. Because the player ignited the TNT that killed the enderman, they receive experience orbs.

Using this farm it is possible to get to level 30 in minutes, provided enough spawning pads have been built.

## Endermite lure trap
### Description
The endermite lure trap is one of the cheapest and most efficient enderman farms, requiring only blocks, a name tag, and a minecart (a boat is inefficient as it can block enderman from getting in) while relying on enderman aggression toward
the endermite that spawned by an ender pearl. By naming the endermite and trapping it in a minecart, a permanent lure is created, and all endermen that spawn within 62 blocks and sight of the endermite pathfind to the endermite and attack it. The enderman can then be routed to a collection point where they can be farmed. If desired, the endermen can be dropped 43 blocks to take sufficient fall damage to render them one hit. To increase spawn rates, the farm can be built at least 128 blocks away from the main end island or any other areas where endermen can spawn. Alternatively, spawning on the main island can be prevented by lighting it up above light level 7, or by covering the main island with slabs or water.

## Under the platform
This design does not yield as much as some, but it is good for starting out. Start in the Overworld, and later switch to the end.

To start building, make a 2-high pillar out of dirt or another easily mined block. Then, make a small platform on the pillar out of cobblestone (obsidian if you have it) that is 2×2 or 3×3.

When there is an enderman nearby, look at its head until the anger animation shows. Quickly stand under the platform and hit the endermen repeatedly.

To cover a larger area, simply build extra platforms.

## Extremely efficient design

This design is extremely efficient and uses only a few resources. docm77's design:
