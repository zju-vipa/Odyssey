## Summary
- Players can now use both hands to do different actions with the left and right mouse buttons.
	- For example, if a player has a pickaxe in their main hand and a torch in their off-hand, right-clicking will place the torch.
		- This happens because a pickaxe lacks a right-click use, and therefore the game tries to then treat the other item as if it's being right-clicked.
- Players can put an item on the "off-hand slot" in their inventory to hold it on their off-hand.
	- It is distinguished by an outline of a shield like symbol.
	- PressingF(by default) will switch whatever item is selected in the hotbar with the item in the off-hand (including no item).
	- The off-hand slot is displayed next to the HUD when it's not empty (left for right-handed players and vice versa).
- Only the main hand can be used for attacking or breaking.
	- An exception is items which do damage uponusingthem, such as bows or splash potions.
- Bows determine what type of arrow to shoot based on the player's inventory and off-hand.
	- Arrows in the off-hand take priority over arrows in any other slot.
		- Otherwise, the closest stack of arrows to the first slot is used.
	- If the bow is in the off-hand, the selected hotbar slot takes priority.
	- If there are multiple arrow types and none held on the off-hand or main hand, the arrow on the first hotbar slot will shoot first.
- The off-hand is invisible in first person view while it's empty.

### Final note
Dual wielding a pickaxe in the main hand and a torch in the off-hand. This reduces the time lighting up tunnels when mining.
Dual wielding is a useful addition to the game with many applications. It is entirely optional for players whether or not they want to utilize dual wielding; players can completely ignore the off-hand slot and, with few exceptions aside, continue to play like it was before 1.9. Some players who use dual wielding may experience efficiency and relief, but others may just experience more setbacks. Some may only use dual wielding to its minimal extent. Ultimately it is up to each player and their own style of playing to employ this mechanic into their gameplay.

Simply holding right-click will eat the food in the off-hand slot, regardless of what item is in the main hand, saving time as the player does not have to select the food in the hotbar. Food is not wasted as you can't consume food when theHunger Baris full. Having your food in the off-hand also frees a space on your hotbar, so you can put another item to use.Equipping a Golden Apple on your off-hand allows you to quickly eat your apple before going immediately into combat with your opponent, but do note that you can consume a golden apple while your hunger is still full, so this method may be reserved until you are certain that you will go into battle soon. |
