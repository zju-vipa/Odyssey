## Development
On January 31, 2022, it was announced that the beta program would be expanded to other platforms, starting with iOS and iPadOS, in the form of Minecraft Preview app, separate from the normal Bedrock Edition app. The initial iOS and iPadOS launch was only limited to 500 users on TestFlight[6], which was later expanded by adding 500 more later on.[7]

Later on February 7, 2022, Minecraft Preview was released for Xbox players via Xbox Insider Hub first, to test the migration of player worlds to the new app. The testing period was divided into two phases, for which users who don't own Minecraft can participate in[5], before it is officially released only to those who have bought Minecraft on Xbox.[8]

After the Minecraft Preview releases on iOS, iPadOS, and Xbox, the app released on Windows on February 9, 2022 and on PlayStation on February 15, 2024. Only players who own and bought the game can download and play Minecraft Preview.[9]
