# Splash
Splash texts are the yellow lines of text on the title screen. They are randomly chosen from the list below and often feature references to popular culture (e.g. websites, quotes, and video games). The splash pulsates on the title screen twice per second.

Splash texts are not translated and appear the same regardless of the language setting chosen. In Java Edition, the splashes are defined in a plain-text file within the minecraft.jar file (specifically, in version.jar/assets/minecraft/texts/splashes.txt). In Bedrock Edition, the splashes are defined in a splashes.json file.
Splashes can be modified by editing the edition's respective file via a resource pack.
