# Tutorials/Thunderstorm survival
Thunderstorms are a very dangerous weather condition. They darken the world enough to allow monster spawning during the day. Lightning may strike, setting fire to the surrounding blocks, mutating monsters, and possibly killing the player. However, they can be a good challenge for a well-established player.

## Basic dangers
This is a picture of what the Overworld looks like during a thunderstorm. Despite the fact that it is actually daytime, Monsters are able to spawn.
If you decide to go out during a thunderstorm, be prepared to fight monsters. Thunderstorms come without warning and, due to the low light level, monsters will spawn. If you are not ready, retreat to your house and wait it out. If you are stuck outside accidentally, either make an emergency shelter (dig down three blocks, jump in and place dirt over your head or a similar design) or just try to fight the monsters and avoid lightning as best as you can.

Keep your health high to avoid a higher risk of dying. Try to keep your hunger bar over (17 ( × 8.5) to keep healing, and if it gets below 6 (), you won't be able to sprint. In case of this, you should keep a food store, so that you can grab food if you happen to need some. An example of a good food to stock up on would be baked potatoes. Remember that it is possible for lightning to strike you by surprise. Fortunately, the lightning actually hitting you is extraordinarily rare, and it only deals 5 damage, but it will set you on fire, which can deal a lot of damage if you don't have armor and can't get into the rain.

### Fires
Every time lightning strikes, it will start a fire. Usually, the rain will quickly put the fire out, but the fire will remain lit if it is under a ledge or on netherrack and certain other blocks, allowing it to spread.

If you see a fire, put it out as quickly as possible. If you do not have a bucket, you can break the fire simply by punching the fire's hitbox. If it is not put out, it could spread and, although there is a limit to how far it can spread individually, it is still undesirable, especially if near the player. If you don't have a water bucket to put out the fire, and it's too big to break with your fist, just get away, and the fire should eventually stop.

### Notes
Lightning can only strike in the rain. This means that snowy and dry warm biomes cannot have lightning, which cuts many of the hazards, such as fire and getting struck by lightning. However, you still have an "unexpected nighttime", as monsters can spawn, even if there is no rain.

## Mobs
Every single lightning strike could potentially spawn a skeleton trap (see below). Lightning strikes can also change mobs in these ways:

- Creeperswill become charged if struck by lightning. This gives them a blue aura around them and doubles their blast radius and damage. It is good to have some blast protection armor or a shield.
- Pigswill turn intozombified piglinsif struck by lightning. These are a version ofpiglinsnormally found only in thenetherand are passive until hit.
- Villagerswill turn intowitchesif struck by lightning. These mobs throw potions at the player and drink health potions themselves.

Remember that this will only occur if the mob(s) that are transformed in question are within 3 blocks of the lightning. However rare it may be, it's good to know in case they are present.

### Skeleton traps
A skeleton trap before activation
Skeleton traps look like bone/skeletal horses when created, but as soon as the player comes within ten blocks, the horse transforms into a skeleton horseman, and three more spawn instantly near it. They have the AI of a skeleton or skeleton jockey and the speed and agility of a horse. What's more, they don't despawn, and they don't burn if the sun comes out again due to their enchanted iron helmets. Their bows are enchanted as well.

Skeleton traps have a 0.75% to 6.75% chance of spawning in a lightning strike, depending on difficulty. They do not spawn on peaceful mode.

Never get too close to a skeleton trap unless you're prepared. If, during or after a thunderstorm, you see a horse that looks like a skeleton version of a normal horse, beware. The safest way to fight them is with a bow, and a shield. However, you may want to activate a skeleton trap for one of these reasons:

- The skeletons have enchanted armor and weapons, each with an 8.5% chance of being dropped.
- If you kill the skeleton, the horse becomes yours, which is handy if you are in abiomethat does not have normalhorses. It is also the fastest type of horse you can get without breeding.
- Skeleton horses sink in water and do not force you to dismount in water, allowing you to travel on the ocean floor with a Potion of Water Breathing.

Generally, iron armor is enough to deal with them. Make use of a bow if you're confident in your abilities in not hitting the horses.
