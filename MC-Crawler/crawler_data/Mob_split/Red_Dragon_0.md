## Planned
For upcoming versions to the game, see Planned versions § Java Edition.

These features are planned to come to Minecraft sometime in the future.

### Combat changes
Main article: Java Edition Combat Tests
A new combat system is currently in development, containing changes such as the player only being able to attack when their weapon is fully drawn. However, as of 2024, the latest combat test is Combat Test 8c, which was released in August 2020.

### Voted updates
The desert and savanna biome reworks are the two remaining biome frameworks from the MINECON Earth 2018 biome chooser vote. Although no date has been given, both are promised to be updated in a future update:[1][2]

- Deserts will be given palm trees, oases, and meerkats.
- Savannas will be given baobab trees, termites, and ostriches.

The badlands biome rework is the last remaining biome rework from the MINECON Live 2019 biome vote, as the winning mountains rework was implemented in 1.18, and the swamp rework was part of 1.19. The badlands are promised to be updated in an unspecified future update:

- Badlands will be given vultures, tumbleweed, and a new cactus based on thePrickly Pear.

Other live votes did not promise that the losing options would be planned; for information on those features, see the "Mentioned" section.

### Super Fancy graphics
Docm77 confirmed in a tweet that sometime in the future, a new graphics setting will be added to Minecraft called "super fancy". It is unknown whether it is the "Fabulous!" graphics setting added in Java Edition 1.16 Pre-release 1 or another new one. The use of OpenGL 3.2 for rendering in Java Edition 1.17 may lead toward the Super Fancy graphics. This could also be a reference to the Ray Tracing functionality in Bedrock Edition or the scrapped Super Duper Graphics Pack.[3]

### Full split of liquids from blocks


Java Edition 1.13 added waterlogging, marking the start of the separation between liquids and blocks. An in-development screenshot showing water occupying leaves and flowers, referred to as having "no water blocks", was released in 2018.[4] However, water and lava still currently exist as blocks, and so far only water sources can occupy other blocks through the waterlogged block state; flowing water and bubble columns cannot occupy other blocks, and both still and flowing lava cannot occupy other blocks at all.

Having water only occupy one side of a block like a glass pane, but not the other, is also something that has been considered.[5]

### Phasing out of NBT-based crafting recipes
In Java Edition 1.14, numerous new blocks were implemented as replacements for certain "complex" crafting recipes, with the replaced crafting recipes relying on NBT data. This included moving inventory tool repair to the grindstone, banner modification to the loom, and map modification to the cartography table. However, several more NBT based crafting recipes still exist, and these are planned to be phased out.[6] Certain blocks that may be added in the future to further this goal include a dedicated fireworks customization block.

In Java Edition 1.14.3, tool repair crafting recipes were reimplemented.

Java Edition 1.20.5 removes the concept of item NBT entirely, making the future of this scheme unclear.
