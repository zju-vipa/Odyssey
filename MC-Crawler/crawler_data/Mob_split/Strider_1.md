### Riding
Main article: Riding
A player riding a strider (click to see animation).
The player can ride on an adult strider using a saddle. 

Similar to how pigs are controlled using a carrot on a stick, striders move forward automatically while their direction is influenced using a warped fungus on a stick, at a speed of 4.14 m/s if on a flat lava surface (such as the Nether lava sea) or 1.74 m/s if on land. They walk especially slowly against the lava flow direction.

Warped fungus on a stick can be used, causing the strider to boost and walk at a greater speed[more information needed] and taking 1 point of durability from the warped fungus on a stick. They also follow players holding a warped fungus or a warped fungus on a stick. 

Unlike underwater boats, players riding striders are not dismounted if the strider submerges in lava, and striders rise back up to the surface if this happens. However, players risk getting burned by the lava while submerged. In Bedrock Edition, players can start riding a strider that is fully submerged in lava.

A strider ridden into flowing lava slowly rises to the top. Fall damage does not affect striders that have dropped onto flowing lava, unlike the bug[4] for lava source blocks. When ridden over land, striders automatically walk up any one block high slope. They also cross any 1-wide block gap or air space that is only one block higher - diagonally up - when ridden directly upward and not completely sideways to the slope.

To safely dismount from a strider, a player who does not have Fire Resistance may face a solid block within reach before dismounting to dismount onto that block,[5] instead of at the strider's location (which is usually in lava[6]).‌[JE  only][7]

Striders can still be equipped with a saddle while another mob is riding it.

### Breeding
Main article: Breeding
If striders are given warped fungus, they breed to create baby striders, granting the player 1–7 experience orbs. The parent striders have a cooldown of about 5 minutes before they can breed again. All babies obtained through breeding take 20 minutes to grow up. The growth of baby striders can be slowly accelerated using warped fungus; each use takes 10% off of the remaining time to grow up.
