### Taken equipment
Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up.

### Naturally-spawned equipment
Husk have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment (other than Halloween pumpkins), with random durability. Each level of Looting increases the chance 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III). These items include:

- Iron Shovel
- Iron Sword
- Random Armor(sometimesenchanted, made from leather, gold, chainmail, iron or diamond)

### Experience
Adult husks drop 5 and an additional 1–3 per naturally-spawned equipment. Baby husks drop 12.
