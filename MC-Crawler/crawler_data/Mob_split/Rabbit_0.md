## Spawning
Rabbits spawn above grass, snow blocks, or sand. They generate individually after the generation of the world.

Rabbits of the following colors spawn in the following biomes:

- Cream:
	- Desert
- White,Black & White:
	- Snowy Plains
	- Snowy Taiga
	- Grove
	- Snowy Slopes
	- Frozen Ocean‌[BE  only]
	- Frozen River‌[BE  only]
	- Snowy Beach‌[BE  only]
- Black,Brown,Brown & White:
	- Flower Forest
	- Taiga
	- Meadow
	- Old Growth Pine Taiga‌[JE  only]
	- Old Growth Spruce Taiga‌[JE  only]
	- Cherry Grove

Cream rabbits are the most common rabbit color and are found only in deserts and its variants. White and black and white rabbits are also quite common and spawn in snowy biomes such as snowy taigas, snowy plains, groves and snowy slopes. Default rabbit colors such as brown, black and salt and pepper spawn naturally in flower forests, taigas and meadows, but can also spawn in any other non-snowy biome via spawn eggs, commands, spawners or breeding. In all these places, groups of an adult and one to two babies spawn.

In Bedrock Edition, up to three kits spawn in flower forests and rabbits can also spawn in frozen aquatic biomes: snowy beaches, frozen oceans, and frozen rivers.

In Java Edition, rabbits can also be found in giant tree taigas.

In taigas, wolves and foxes are also found. If left alone, these may quickly kill rabbits, so rabbits are generally more plentiful in the desert, flowery or icy biomes.

The Killer Bunny does not spawn naturally and must instead be spawned using the /summon command, although it is exclusive to Java Edition.

Killing a kit yields no items nor experience.

## Behavior
Rabbits hop around aimlessly instead of walking. They can jump up almost 2 blocks in height. They slowly approach players holding carrots, golden carrots or dandelions within 8 blocks. They don't follow the players that hold carrot on a stick although pigs do.[1] Rabbits also jump off of cliffs to reach carrots but do not go into lava for them. They randomly flee around if attacked. All non-hostile rabbits avoid players within 8 blocks and avoid most hostile mobs within 4 blocks (except slimes, magma cubes, and ghasts). They also avoid wolves within 10 blocks.

If /gamerule mobGriefing is true, rabbits find and eat mature carrot crops‌[Java Edition  only] / carrot crops with growth stage greater than 1‌[Bedrock Edition  only]. This reduces the growth stage by one, removing the crop completely when the growth stage reaches 0.

Wild wolves, foxes, and stray cats track down and kill any rabbits.

### Breeding
Rabbits can be bred using carrots, golden carrots or dandelions.

Baby rabbits usually inherit the same type of fur as one of the parents (47.5% chance of each), but there is a 5% chance for the baby to have the fur type matching the current biome. Baby rabbits grow to adulthood after 20 minutes, although their growth can be slowly accelerated using carrots, golden carrots or dandelions; each use reduces 10% of the remaining time to grow up.

Despite their hostile nature, killer bunnies can breed with other rabbits and with each other, having the unusual chance of creating a baby killer bunny.

A Toast  rabbit does not produce a Toast rabbit baby, however.

In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, baby rabbits follow their parents; this behavior is absent in Java Edition.[2]
