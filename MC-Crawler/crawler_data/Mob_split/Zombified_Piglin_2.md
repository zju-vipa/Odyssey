### Hostility
Zombified piglins are not initially hostile, but all zombified piglins within a 67×22×67 to 111×22×111 area‌[JE  only] or a 20-block radius‌[BE  only] centered on an attacked zombified piglin become aggressive and converge on the attacker (another mob or player, except goats and ghasts) if any individual is attacked, unless the zombified piglin attacked is killed in one hit.[4]‌[JE  only] They make an aggressive sound when angered. In addition, some zombified piglins have the ability to spawn reinforcements when attacked (similar to zombies and which can rarely include actual zombies).‌[JE  only] This applies to any hit registered as coming from the player or other mobs, whether it's accidentally or purposefully, which includes deflected ghast fireballs, sweep attacks, snowballs and eggs, fireworks shot from crossbows, TNT, Wind Charges, or a skeleton arrow. Arrows shot from dispensers or bed explosions[5] don't provoke zombified piglins.

Duration: A zombified piglin can remain hostile indefinitely if it is both within the follow range of the zombified piglin (33 to 55 blocks), and has a direct line of sight with the player. However, breaking one of those conditions causes a hostile zombified piglin to return neutral after a "forgiveness timer" expires. In Java Edition, this timer ranges from 20 seconds to 55 seconds, whereas in Bedrock Edition it is always 25 seconds. The forgiveness timer does not advance for zombified piglins in unloaded chunks. Therefore, if the player enters a nether portal and returns, any provoked zombified piglins in the area remain aggressive (unless another player was nearby to keep the chunks loaded). A player's death causes zombified piglins to become neutral toward the player if the gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers is true.‌[JE  only]

A hostile zombified piglin can also "sound an alarm", spreading the aggro to all zombified piglins within a 67×22×67 to 111×22×111 area ‌[JE  only] or 20-block‌[BE  only] radius. A hostile zombified piglin does this whenever the targeted player is within their follow range (33 to 55 blocks) and has a constant line-of-sight with its target, then it does the same every 4–6 seconds (80-120 game ticks), recruiting any formerly-neutral peers. They pursue players even if they have the Invisibility effect.

In Bedrock Edition, a nearby neutral zombified piglin prevents a player from sleeping, as if it were a hostile mob.

Hostile zombified piglins have slightly different path finding than when they are neutral. For example, they would fall off edges that would cause them fall damage in attempt to reach the attacker where most other mobs would otherwise not do.

When a zombified piglin is angered, the normal piglins do not get aggressive, and vice versa.

Unlike other zombie variants, zombified piglins do not attack villagers and wandering traders.
