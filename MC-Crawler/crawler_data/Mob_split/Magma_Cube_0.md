# Magma Cube
A magma cube is a hostile mob found in the Nether. A magma cube behaves similarly to a slime, but is fireproof, jumps higher and less often, and deals more damage.

## Spawning
See also: Spawn § Spawn cycle

Magma cubes spawn in areas of the Nether at all light levels. The space they spawn in must be clear of solid obstructions and liquids. Due to being inherently fireproof, magma cubes can spawn on magma blocks. 

Only sizes 1, 2 and 4 (NBT Size tag values 0, 1 and 3 respectively) spawn naturally. With use of /summon, magma cubes can potentially range from size 1 to 127 (NBT Size tag 0–126).[verify]

This large magma cube attempts to spawn on the basalt, but because there is a piece of iron bar intersecting its hitbox, it is unable to spawn. This check is performed before the size of the magma cube is determined, meaning no magma cubes can spawn at that location.
A magma cube needs roughly a 3×2.1×3 free space to spawn. The area in which they spawn must be clear of solid or liquid obstructions. When a magma cube attempts to spawn, the game checks for the space requirement of a large magma cube, and the size is determined later. Therefore, since large magma cubes are slightly taller than 2 blocks, no magma cubes, regardless of size, are able to spawn at all in 2-block-high areas. Also, since large magma cubes are slightly wider than 2 blocks, and mobs spawn at the center of a block, having any block within the 3×2.1×3 area, even as thin as a glass pane, can prevent a magma cube of any size from spawning.

Magma cubes' size is affected by regional difficulty: chances range from 33% for each size at the low difficulty to 16% small, 33% medium, and 50% big with higher difficulty.

### Nether Wastes
Magma cubes spawn uncommonly in Nether wastes in groups of 1 to 4.

### Nether Fortresses
Magma cubes spawn commonly in Nether fortresses in groups of 4.

### Basalt Deltas
Magma cubes spawn commonly in basalt deltas, in groups of 2 to 5.

### Spawners
Magma cube monster spawners generate in the treasure room of bastions.
