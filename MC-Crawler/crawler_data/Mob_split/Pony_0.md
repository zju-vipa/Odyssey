# Java Edition 2.0
On April 1, 2013, Mojang released a hoax announcement for Minecraft 2.0, a new game they had supposedly been working on for two years, describing how it would "bring blocky simulation games to the next level." The post also contained a changelog comprised mostly of nonsensical changes, such as a new slab of TNT called the Etho slab, and the addition of coal blocks (which did not exist at the time).

### Blocks
Etho Slab

- Can be crafted with 3 TNT:



Ingredients
Crafting recipe


TNT

6


- Much like other slabs, it can be placed on the lower or upper half of a block.
- It has the same functions as a normal TNT; however, when it explodes, it spawns ananvilover entities in the explosion's range, including Players.
	- This and the block's name are references toEthosLab, a Minecraft YouTuber who often tries to kill players with fallinganvils.

Torch (Burnt-out)
- The data value is 161.
- Torchesnow burn out after a random amount of ticks.
- They can be relit withflint and steel.
- Burnt-out torches were originally supposed to be added in theHalloween Update, wherelanternswere supposed to be the new light source. However, this feature wasn't added to the Halloween Update before release and was later officially rejected.

Block of Coal
- The data value is 162.
- Just like the other mineral blocks, it is crafted with 3×3coal:



Ingredients
Crafting recipe


Coal




- However, when it is put into the crafting table to get back the coal, the coal obtained is not stackable with other coal, because it has a different item data value: 32767 instead of 0. This is likely an intentional bug.
- Was coded in as a joke, but was added later in the next update as an authentic block.
- Showed speech bubbles such as "Ouch" when punched, and eventually struck the ground with lightning if punched enough times.
- This block was later added into Minecraft inJava Edition 1.6.1with the same texture as from the April Fools version, but it was later retextured.

Tinted Glass
- Has a data value of 163.
- Is opaque.
- Glass can bedyedany color that the dye exists for, and yields 8 tinted glass of the corresponding color:

- Containsblock datavalues ranging from 0–15 that specify the color of the glass.Wool's block data valuesproduce the same colors when used on tinted glass.
- InJava Edition 1.7.2, tinted glass was added to the game under the name stained glass.
	- At its first introduction,13w41a, it used the 2.0 textures, but it was changed in the next snapshot,13w42a.
- InJava Edition 1.17,tinted glasswas added. It is unlikely that the identical naming of these blocks was intentional.
