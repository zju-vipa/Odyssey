### Ramming
Every 30 to 300 seconds, a goat tries to ram a single unmoving target it can see within a range of 4–16 blocks. They can target players, armor stands, cameras‌[BE & edu  only], or any mob except for ghasts and other goats. A charging goat locks on to its target's position, lowers its head, stomps, and speeds toward the target. If the charge connects, it deals 1 to 3 damage (depending on difficulty) and 9 blocks of knockback to its target, possibly resulting in a damaging or even fatal fall. This attack is not affected by Thorns.[1]

As a goat lowers its head, its target has the chance to move out of the way. If a goat misses, it stops itself within a couple blocks, unless it hits a solid block first. If a goat rams a solid block that occurs naturally in its environment, it can drop one of its goat horns.

Mobs do not retaliate to being rammed, except for piglins, piglin brutes, hoglins, zoglins, "Johnny" vindicators and wardens.[2]

Goats don't target players in Creative mode or any players in Peaceful difficulty. Unlike most neutral mobs, goats do not attack the player if the player attacks it and do not call for backup if harmed.

Baby goats deal a knockback of 4.5 blocks. A screaming goat's ramming cooldown is 5 to 15 seconds.[more information needed]

### Milking
An adult goat can be milked by using a bucket on it, yielding a milk bucket.

### Breeding
Main article: Breeding
Goats follow players that are within ten blocks who are holding wheat. If adult goats are fed wheat, they enter love mode and breed, granting one to seven experience orbs. The growth time of a baby goat can be accelerated by 10% each time it is fed wheat.

If a standard goat is bred with a screaming goat, there is approximately a 50% chance the resulting baby is a screaming goat. If both goats are screaming, there is a 100% chance in Java Edition and a 98% chance in Bedrock Edition that the baby is a screaming goat. Otherwise, there is a 2% chance of a baby goat being a regular goat.

Baby goats only have horns if they are summoned through one of two commands: /summon goat ~ ~ ~ {Age:-24000, HasLeftHorn:1} or /summon goat ~ ~ ~ {Age:-24000, HasRightHorn:1}.
