### Villagers
Main article: Villager § Breeding
A group of villager children playing tag.
Villagers do not breed automatically when given food. Villager breeding depends on both the number of valid beds in the area (see the village page for full details), as well as whether the villagers are "willing." A villager may become willing if they have 3 bread, 12 carrots, 12 potatoes, or 12 beetroots in their inventory. They may also become willing as a result of trading with a player. When they breed, they produce a smaller villager. Unlike many baby animals, baby villagers do not have big heads in Java Edition. Zombie villagers and wandering traders cannot breed, and baby zombie villagers do not grow up.

## Baby mobs
An example of how a bred sheep inherits a mixture of its parents' colors when possible.
Baby mobs are smaller variations of their adult counterparts, having small bodies, relatively big heads (with some exceptions), and faster walking speeds. Their sounds are the same as their adult variants but 50% faster and are pitched up by 6 semitones. The only exception to this are tadpoles, which are a wholly unique mob from frogs. Many baby mobs have different interactions or behavior compared to their elders that depends on the mob. For example, lambs cannot be sheared for their wool, calves, mooshroom calves and kids (baby goats) cannot be milked, and baby piglins take gold but do not barter. Most baby mobs do not drop loot or experience when killed, with the exception of items they pick up. Baby mobs that do drop loot or experience consist of the following:

- Babyzombies,zombie villagers,husks,drowned,zombified piglinsandzoglins(both loot and experience)
- Babyhoglins(only experience)
- Babypiglins(only experience, less than adults)

Most baby animals choose and follow an adult within 8 blocks of the same species, regardless of whether it is their parent. Babies can choose new targets to follow whenever they do not have a valid target, such as when the previous target dies or moves further than 16 blocks away. Tamed pups and kittens follow their owner if the parent is absent or sitting. Baby animals that do not follow adults consist of:

- Tadpoles(which do not followfrogs)
- Snifflets[1]
- Babyrabbits‌[Java Edition  only][2]
- Babyturtles‌[Java Edition  only][3]
- Ocelotkittens‌[Java Edition  only][3]
- Stray kittens‌[Java Edition  only][3]
- Wildwolfpups‌[Java Edition  only][3]

Baby mobs that are not animals never follow adult mobs.

When a baby of a species with different fur/pattern variants is born, they usually inherit the pattern of one of their parents, chosen at random, with some exceptions: 

- In the case ofsheep, if the parents have "compatible" colors (meaning that their correspondingdyeitems could be combined into a third dye), the lamb inherits a mix of the parents' colors‌[Java Edition  only].
- In the case ofmooshrooms, breeding two of the same variant has a1⁄1024chance to spawn a mooshroom of the opposite variant. Breeding two mooshrooms of differing variants has an equal chance of a baby mooshroom of either type.
- In the case ofhorses, there is a13⁄45chance of having a random color/markings instead of matching either of its parents.
- In the case ofaxolotls, a baby axolotl bred by a player (not found in the world) has a1⁄1200chance to be the rare blue variant, with this being the only way to obtain this variant. Otherwise, it inherits the color of one of its parents at random.
- Frogsdo not inherit their variants from their parents. A frog's variant is determined by the biome it matures from atadpolein.


Baby animals can be manually spawned by using spawn eggs on a grown animal. This also works on zombies or variants. Baby animals may also be spawned using the /summon command with a negative Age tag; for example, using /summon sheep ~ ~ ~ {Age:-100} spawns a baby sheep at the player's position, that matures in 100 ticks (5 seconds). For baby mobs that don't grow up like zombies and piglins, the IsBaby:1 tag is used instead.
Feed graphic for baby animals in Java Edition.
Most baby mobs take 20 minutes to grow up. This can be accelerated by feeding them their breeding item. Green sparkles appear similar to those caused by bone meal. in Java Edition, each feeding usually reduces the remaining time before the animal grows up by 10%. The less time remains, the less time is saved by each feeding, making it inefficient to feed an animal continuously until it becomes an adult. After the eighth feeding, the time saved by one feeding is less than a minute, as shown in the graph. in Bedrock Edition, each feeding saves 10% of the total time rather than the remaining time, so it will take no more than ten feedings to age up a single baby.

Horses, donkeys, and llamas have different mechanics: different breeding items grow babies by different amounts, and each item ages babies by a constant time rather than a percentage of the remaining time. Skeleton horses and zombie horses are not breedable, but they can be fed while being ridden by another mob.

Baby zombies, zombie villagers, husks, drowned, zombified piglins, piglins, and zoglins do not grow up, and none of these mobs can breed.

Polar bears have a baby form that can grow up into an adult, but cannot be bred. This also applies to squid, glow squid and dolphins in Bedrock Edition.
