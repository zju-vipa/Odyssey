# Tuff Golem
The tuff golem was a proposed mob featured in the Mob Vote during Minecraft Live 2022, alongside the sniffer and rascal.[1] It was a golem that would have been built by the player. If a wool block was included while building it, the tuff golem would have worn a cloak matching the color of the wool.
